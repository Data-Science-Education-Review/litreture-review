b1452907e85f6e4d315ca8c61a1393403a533b2f,leading the way a new model for data science education,"Addressing the data skills gap, namely the superabundance of data and the lack of human capital to exploit it, this paper argues that iSchools and Library and Information Science programs are ideal venues for data science education. It unpacks two case studies: the LIS Education and Data Science for the National Digital Platform (LEADS‐4‐NDP) project (2017–2019), and the LIS Education and Data Science‐Integrated Network Group (LEADING) project (2020–2023). These IMLS‐funded initiatives respond to four national digital platform challenges: LIS faculty prepared to teach data science and mentor the next generation of educators and practitioners, an underdeveloped pedagogical infrastructure, scattered and inconsistent data science education opportunities for students and current information professionals, and an immature data science network. LEADS and LEADING have made appreciable collaborative, interdisciplinary contributions to the data science education community; these projects comprise an essential part of the long‐awaited and much‐needed national digital platform."

However, there is little research on ethics education in computer science that explicitly addresses data ethics. We present and analyze Re-Shape, a method to teach students about the ethical implications of data collection and use. Re-Shape, as part of an educational environment, builds upon the idea of cultivating care and allows students to collect, process, and visualize their physical movement data in ways that support critical reflection and coordinated classroom activities about data, data privacy, and human-centered systems for data science. We also use a case study of Re-Shape in an undergraduate computer science course to explore prospects and limitations of instructional designs and educational technology such as Re-Shape that leverage personal data to teach data ethics."
41cf91ee13a1d15983ede066ddf6b67cc94a41f4,the role of academia in data science education,"As the demand for data scientists continues to grow, universities are trying to figure out how to best contribute to the training of a workforce. However, there does not appear to be a consensus on the fundamental principles, expertise, skills, or knowledge-base needed to define an academic discipline. We argue that data science is not a discipline but rather an umbrella term used to describe a complex process involving not one data scientist possessing all the necessary expertise, but a team of data scientists with nonoverlapping complementary skills. We provide some recommendations for how to take this into account when designing data science academic programs.Keywords: applied statistics, data science, data science curriculum, data wrangling, machine learning, software engineering"
5d090dbeae225383d56ee7ac17b611adeb21c3e3,data science education curriculum and pedagogy,"Data science is a new field of research focuses on extracting knowledge and value from data. The radical growth in recent years in the availability of data and of the computational resources required to process them, has led to a corresponding increase in demand for data scientists. As a result, new data science education programs are opening at a growing rate. Over the past few years, several papers on data science programs were published, focusing on their curricular aspects. The pedagogy of those programs, however, has received only little attention. To partially close this gap, my doctoral research focuses on the pedagogical aspects of data science. The pilot phase of the research was carried out in graduate, undergraduate, and high school data science programs. The results of the pilot research are organized by a framework of ten challenges of data science education whose purpose is to improve our understanding of the pedagogical challenges of data science education for various populations and to develop pedagogical methods for coping with them. The current stage of research aims to validate this framework."

The new report highlights the importance of data science education already at the pre-college levels. Future articles in the Minding the Future column will showcase examples of data science activities that are suitable for school children at different stages of their education, from the earliest primary levels and up through secondary. In a companion column, a current high school student shares her perspective on the importance of data science courses at the pre-college level. The Pre-K-12 Report discussed in this column is accessible HERE."
80c291b8d0585e13b1367d790840560df4d653d5,ad hoc efforts for advancing data science education,"With increasing demand for training in data science, extracurricular or “ad hoc” education efforts have emerged to help individuals acquire relevant skills and expertise. Although extracurricular efforts already exist for many computationally intensive disciplines, their support of data science education has significantly helped in coping with the speed of innovation in data science practice and formal curricula. While the proliferation of ad hoc efforts is an indication of their popularity, less has been documented about the needs that they are designed to meet, the limitations that they face, and practical suggestions for holding successful efforts. To holistically understand the role of different ad hoc formats for data science, we surveyed organizers of ad hoc data science education efforts to understand how organizers perceived the events to have gone—including areas of strength and areas requiring growth. We also gathered recommendations from these past events for future organizers. Our results suggest that the perceived benefits of ad hoc efforts go beyond developing technical skills and may provide continued benefit in conjunction with formal curricula, which warrants further investigation. As increasing numbers of researchers from computational fields with a history of complex data become involved with ad hoc efforts to share their skills, the lessons learned that we extract from the surveys will provide concrete suggestions for the practitioner-leaders interested in creating, improving, and sustaining future efforts."
b22d078fd2d9115f7f159dc796636fb6a706f141,ethics in data science education,"There is a growing recognition of the importance of ethics education in data science programs. Recent news stories about data breaches and algorithmic biases indicate that big data projects raise ethical concerns with the potential to inflict harm on a wide societal or global scale. In this paper, we address three main research questions: (1) what curricular recommendations have been proposed for the teaching of ethics in undergraduate data science courses, (2) what codes of ethics are relevant to data science, and (3) how can we characterize the proposed codes to help an educator choose which to include in a data science course? We conclude with an overview of an approach to teaching ethics in undergraduate data science courses."
b85ac20631159ca3e370afa9c1f81a4618242b4f,the democratization of data science education,"Abstract Over the last three decades, data have become ubiquitous and cheap. This transition has accelerated over the last five years and training in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis has struggled to keep up. In April 2014, we launched a program of nine courses, the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization, which has now had more than 4 million enrollments over the past five years. Here, the program is described and compared to standard data science curricula as they were organized in 2014 and 2015. We show that novel pedagogical and administrative decisions introduced in our program are now standard in online data science programs. The impact of the Data Science Specialization on data science education in the U.S. is also discussed. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts about the future of data science education in a data democratized world."

This special session seeks to introduce the work of the ACM Data Science Task Force as well as to engage the SIGCSE community in this effort. Members of the task force will introduce key components of a draft report, including a summary of data science curricular efforts to date, results of ACM academic and industry surveys on data science, as well as the initial articulation of computing competencies for undergraduate programs in data science. This session should be of interest to all SIGCSE attendees, but especially faculty developing college-level curricula in Data Science."
7d182b35736231f88b8d44c1225e696cabc21a63,toward holistic data science education,"Holistic data science education places data science in the context of real world applications, emphasizing the purpose for which data were collected, the pedigree of the data, the meaning inherent in the daa, the deploying of sustainable solutions, and the communication of key findings for addressing the original problem. As such it spends less emphasis on coding, computing, and high-end black-box algorithms. We argue that data science education must move toward a holistic curriculum, and we provide examples and reasons for this emphasis.

2f632f9626fbe6298c474906736ba83ad10a70b1,data science education global perspectives and convergence,"Over the past two decades, data science or data analytics degree programs have begun to emerge, reflecting the world's demand for data specialists to make sense of the vast amounts of collected data in the sciences, engineering, business, and other domains. As degree creation has occurred mainly due to demand, ACM and other professional bodies have recently stepped in to provide curricular guidance. However, no \em shared global framework for data science as an academic discipline exists, making growth unfocused and driven by employer demands. More recently, the growth of artificial intelligence has also impacted data science programs. This working group builds on prior efforts and participant experiences to develop a global taxonomy of approaches to data science education and expectations for graduates of data science programs to \em think like data scientists."
0c4eae1c381fceb0db2d8bb1fc2a5729e163ab43,innovation in data science education,"The workshop will allow participants to gain experience with a series of innovations developed at UC Berkeley that have enabled the teaching of undergraduate data science at scale to students from all backgrounds. Rather than beginning with established introductory strategies as the gateway to computer science, students in the ""Foundations of Data Science"" (data8.org) learn computational skills and concepts in relation to real-world issues and with attention to societal implications. By engaging with students' interest in the applications of computing on data, and integrating societal impact from the start, the program has developed a long-term commitment to advance computational skills for large numbers of students. These innovations in teaching not only convey important computational content, but also broaden participation beyond existing approaches to computer science. Goals include increasing diversity among students learning computer science, giving students a strong ethical foundation within their computer science work, and encouraging critical thinking in the application of inference and statistical techniques. Bringing a laptop is recommended. UC Berkeley has as over 1000 students in a large and open Data Science Major, where a range of Domain Emphases and backgrounds bring a broader set of students than the traditional CS major. UC Berkeley Data Science has been gathering over 500 educators in a summer workshop on sharing curricular innovation."
84c89752b4c6fb822ba8621a9fc2751aebf42db6,toward training and assessing reproducible data analysis in data science education,"Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research. Data science is not an exception. In recent years scientists were concerned about a large number of irreproducible studies. Such reproducibility crisis in science could severely undermine public trust in science and science-based public policy. Recent efforts to promote reproducible research mainly focused on matured scientists and much less on student training. In this study, we conducted action research on students in data science to evaluate to what extent students are ready for communicating reproducible data analysis. The results show that although two-thirds of the students claimed they were able to reproduce results in peer reports, only one-third of reports provided all necessary information for replication. The actual replication results also include conflicting claims; some lacked comparisons of original and replication results, indicating that some students did not share a consistent understanding of what reproducibility means and how to report replication results. The findings suggest that more training is needed to help data science students communicating reproducible data analysis."
2146edb37621d80f53c1261c8a53c94d3dda84c8,smart blockchain badges for data science education,"Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionise education in a number of ways. In this paper, we explore the applications of Smart Blockchain Badges on data science education. In particular, we investigate how Smart Blockchain Badges can support learners that want to advance their careers in data science, by offering them personalised recommendations based on their learning achievements. This work aims at enhancing data science accreditation by introducing a robust system based on the Blockchain technology. Learners will benefit from a sophisticated, open and transparent accreditation system, as well as from receiving job recommendations that match their skills and can potentially progress their careers. As a result, this work contributes towards closing the data science skills gap by linking data science education to the industry."
589ebdd0d7b4a58f7fdfb07f116f62681bb9a915,hack weeks as a model for data science education and collaboration,"Significance As scientific disciplines grapple with more datasets of rapidly increasing complexity and size, new approaches are urgently required to introduce new statistical and computational tools into research communities and improve the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas. In this paper, we introduce a type of scientific workshop, called a hack week, which allows for fast dissemination of new methodologies into scientific communities and fosters exchange and collaboration within and between disciplines. We present implementations of this concept in astronomy, neuroscience, and geoscience and show that hack weeks produce positive learning outcomes, foster lasting collaborations, yield scientific results, and promote positive attitudes toward open science. Across many scientific disciplines, methods for recording, storing, and analyzing data are rapidly increasing in complexity. Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices."
ea07f64ad84542e04acc41db6b171007f344efd7,milo a visual programming environment for data science education,"Most courses on Data Science offered at universities or online require students to have familiarity with at least one programming language. In this paper, we present, “Milo”, a web-based visual programming environment for Data Science Education, designed as a pedagogical tool that can be used by students without prior-programming experience. To that end, Milo uses graphical blocks as abstractions of language specific implementations of Data Science and Machine Learning(ML) concepts along with creation of interactive visualizations. Using block definitions created by a user, Milo generates equivalent source code in JavaScript to run entirely in the browser. Based on a preliminary user study with a focus group of undergraduate computer science students, Milo succeeds as an effective tool for novice learners in the field of Data Science."
bfc866c270f1d3f659140a194d7c4185472f4ecd,the michigan data science team a data science education program with significant social impact,"One role of universities is to provide students with the practical knowledge necessary to address broad societal needs. The growing field of data science has the potential to address many of these needs, primarily due to recent efforts to collect large amounts of data related to social, environmental, and political issues. A challenge is that there exists a disconnect between these real-world issues and the course materials taught to university students. This gap is due in part to a lack of engagement between universities and their local communities, leaving students with few opportunities to work with datasets relevant to real-world problems. To address this disconnect, the authors have implemented a novel data science education and outreach program in which students acquire new knowledge and skills while creating positive social impact through community service. In this work, we outline this outreach program, the Michigan Data Science Team, and provide empirical evidence of positive educational and social impact."

As data capture has increased and artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced, SDS can help to unlock augmented and automated coaching, feedback, assessment, and decision support in surgery. We review major concepts in SDS and AI as applied to surgical education and surgical oncology."
98444fd4a70be8b5ef24f5e48c25daaf4d52e527,statistical literacy for active citizenship a call for data science education,"Data are abundant, quantitative information about the state of society and the wider world is around us more than ever. Paradoxically, recent trends in the public discourse point towards a post-factual world that seems content to ignore or misrepresent empirical evidence. As statistics educators we are challenged to promote understanding of statistics about society. In order to re-root public debate to be based on facts instead of emotions and to promote evidence-based policy decisions, statistics education needs to embrace two areas widely neglected in secondary and tertiary education: understanding of multivariate phenomena and the thinking with and learning from complex data."
77e79037232f503d43a3ced2315cb1622f705d28,architecting data science education,"Data scientists are currently among the most demanded professionals in many spheres, including industries, governments, public sector, among others. This is due to several good reasons. Probably an important one of those reasons is the growing demand to find proper ways to face the challenges of establishing data-driven economies and societies. As academics and educationalists, but also Data Science professionals, we look at how to bring up this kind of specialists such that to meet the current shortages but also mid-term demands. In this position paper we deliberate about how to architect thematically, didactically, and organizationally a university program under the thematic umbrella of Data Science. We focus on the selection of learning units or disciplines to be covered in order to produce the M.Sci. and Ph.D. graduates who will be ready to face the future challenges in the mid-term perspective. We outline our recommendation on using learning tools and materials. We also concisely present the approach for stimulating competitive and cooperative atmosphere in the class that stimulates intensive collective and individual learning. We recommend to reinforce an academic program by involving industrial partners intensively in the process. We ground our deliberation on our experience in implementing relevant M.Sci. and Ph.D. programs in Data Science and Semantic"
e7e187c361b2569b118aa33090a04f570ca5ea4a,data science education were missing the boat again,"In the first wave of data science education programs, data engineering topics (systems, scalable algorithms, data management, integration) tended to be de-emphasized in favor of machine learning and statistical modeling. The anecdotal evidence suggests this was a mistake: data scientists report spending most of their time grappling with data far upstream of modeling activities. A second wave of data science education is emerging, one with increased emphasis on practical issues in ethics, legal compliance, scientific reproducibility, data quality, and algorithmic bias. The data engineering community has a second chance to influence these programs beyond just providing a set of tools. In this panel, we'll discuss the role of data engineering in data science education programs, and how best to capitalize on emerging opportunities in this space."

We investigated the data science education of five LIS (Library and Information Studies) schools in China, using Fudan University’s Data Management and Application Master’s Program as an example for more specific information about the curriculum structure, course focus and teaching methods in data science education. The paper further describes the action of promoting data science and data science education in the field of LIS by the China Academic Library Research Data Management Implementation Group."
ca9f74a1a7b69214c670202bb4f66eb16194f836,datathons an experience report of data hackathons for data science education,Large amounts of data are becoming increasingly available through open data repositories as well as companies and governments collecting data to improve decision making and efficiencies. Consequently there is a need to increase the data literacy of computer science students. Data science is a relatively new area within computer science and the curriculum is rapidly evolving along with the tools required to perform analytics which students need to learn how to effectively use. To address the needs of students learning key data science and analytics skills we propose augmenting existing data science curriculums with hackathon events that focus on data also known as datathons. In this paper we present our experience at hosting and running four datathons that involved students and members from the community coming together to solve challenging problems with data from not-for-profit social good organizations and publicly open data. Our reported experience from our datathons will help inform other academics and community groups who also wish to host datathons to help facilitate their students and members to learn key data science and analytics skills.
58b0bab49633c23e53910925dabd472bab2a99b9,big data science education a case study of a projectfocused introductory course,"This paper reports on a case study of a project-focused introduction to big data science course. The pedagogy of the course leveraged boundary theory, where students were positioned to be at the boundary between a client’s desire to understand their data and the academic class. The results of the case study demonstrate that using live clients within a team-based, project-focused course provides a useful platform in which to teach an introduction to data science course to graduate students across a range of backgrounds. While more work needs to be done to compare different possible pedagogies for teaching an introduction to data science course, the results of this study indicate that one successful approach is a project-focused class that puts students at the boundary between the academic context of the course and solving a real-world problem for their client."
d6c7aaaa5e068cfccc7e9386e5278022285f76d5,is educationadvancing data science education through a transdisciplinary conversation,"S trong interest in data science continues to generate new educational programs and change the landscape around multiple contributing and related academic disciplines, such as computer science, statistics, mathematics , econometrics, information science, and, of course, information systems (IS). In an earlier ACM Inroads column [3], I wrote about the essential role IS could and should have in the discourse that is clarifying the identity of data science and determining the forms this emerging discipline will get when it is implemented in various practical contexts. The purpose of this column is broad-er—it will provide a brief preliminary report on a two-day workshop on Data Science Education that ACM Education Board and Council organized in early October 2015 with funding from the National Science Foundation [2]. Boots Cassel (Villanova University) and Heikki Topi (Bentley University) served as co-chairs of the process. This workshop brought together about twenty-five academic experts representing a broad range of academic disciplines, including not only those described above but also management science/operations research and several scientific and practice domains as diverse as history and chemistry. In addition, a broad range of academic and professional societies were present at The key purpose of the workshop was relatively straightforward—it was intended to create an opportunity for key stakehold-ers in data science to have an open conversation regarding the future of data science education in a neutral environment. Through this process, the organizers were hoping that various stakeholder groups could improve"
ce65e5a9d0b1b3dd78c6abeb781e1ddbd7f63344,a projectbased case study of data science education,"The discipline of data science has emerged over the past decade as a convergence of high-power computing, data visualization and analysis, and data-driven application domains. Prominent research institutions and private sector industry have embraced data science, but foundations for effective tertiary-level data science education remain absent. This is nothing new, however, as the university has an established tradition of developing its educational mission hand-in-hand with the development of novel methods for human understanding (Feingold, 1991). Thus, it is natural that universities “figure out” data science concurrent with the development of needed pedagogy. We consider data science education with respect to recent trends in interdisciplinary and experiential educational methodologies. The first iteration of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) Collaborative, which took place at the University of California, Berkeley in the Spring of 2015, is used as a case study. From this, we draw lessons learned regarding the necessary components of effective tertiary data science education, which range from a complete end-to-end workflow, technological tools for development and team communications, and appropriate motivation and incentives. Our findings will be tested and revised in subsequent iterations of the BIDS Collaborative as we continue our study of data science education, research, and social impact."
e257edf34abd9a191fea1023a423abb497cca70f,the data science education dilemma,"The need for people fluent in working with data is growing rapidly and enormously, but U.S. K–12 education does not provide meaningful learning experiences designed to develop understanding of data science concepts or a fluency with data science skills. Data science is inherently inter- disciplinary, so it makes sense to integrate it with existing content areas, but difficulties abound. Consideration of the work involved in doing data science and the habits of mind that lie behind it leads to a way of thinking about integrating data science with mathematics and science. Examples drawn from current activity development in the Data Games project shed some light on what technology-based, data-driven might be like. The project’s ongoing research on learners’ conceptions of organizing data and the relevance to data science education is explained."

This article consists of an analysis of the Lytics Lab, Stanford University’s laboratory for research and development in learning analytics, and the Center for Digital Data, Analytics and Adaptive Learning, a big data research centre of the commercial education company Pearson. These institutions are becoming methodological gatekeepers with the capacity to conduct new forms of educational research using big data and algorithmic data science methods. The central argument is that as educational data science has migrated from the academic lab to the commercial sector, ownership of the means to produce educational data analyses has become concentrated in the activities of for-profit companies. As a consequence, new theories of learning are being built-in to the tools they provide, in the shape of algorithm-driven technologies of personalization, which can be sold to schools and universities. The paper addresses two themes of this special issue: (1) how education is to be theorized in relation to algorithmic methods and data scientific epistemologies and (2) how the political economy of education is shifting as knowledge production becomes concentrated in data-driven commercial organizations."

Data science is the field of study that involves tools, algorithms, and knowledge of math and statistics to discover knowledge from the raw data. Data science is developing fast and penetrating all spheres of life. More people understand the importance of the science of data and the need for implementation in everyday life. Data science is used in business for business analytics and production, in sales for offerings and, for sales forecasting, in marketing for customizing customers, and recommendations on purchasing, digital marketing, in banking and insurance for risk assessment, fraud detection, scoring, and in medicine for disease forecasting, process automation and patient health monitoring, in tourism in the field of price analysis, flight safety, opinion mining etc. However, data science applications in education have been relatively limited, and many opportunities for advancing the fields still unexplored."

In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work. We highlight creative problem solving and strategies for teaching automation-resilient skills, while providing students the opportunity to create a unique data science project that demonstrates their technical and creative capacities."
c6fb9b0ddd08aebf40bba40d25b6e3656df53dcd,crossdisciplinary higher education of data science beyond the computer science student,"The majority of economic sectors are transformed by the abundance of data. Smart grids, smart cities, smart health, Industry 4.0 impose to domain experts requirements for data science skills in order to respond to their duties and the challenges of the digital society. Business training or replacing domain experts with computer scientists can be costly, limiting for the diversity in business sectors and can lead to sacrifice of invaluable domain knowledge. This paper illustrates experience and lessons learnt from the design and teaching of a novel cross-disciplinary data science course at a postgraduate level in a topclass university. The course design is approached from the perspectives of the constructivism and transformative learning theory. Students are introduced to a guideline for a group research project they need to deliver, which is used as a pedagogical artifact for students to unfold their data science skills as well as reflect within their team their domain and prior knowledge. In contrast to other related courses, the course content illustrated is designed to be self-contained for students of different discipline. Without assuming certain prior programming skills, students from different discipline are qualified to practice data science with opensource tools at all stages: data manipulation, interactive graphical analysis, plotting, machine learning and big data analytics. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation with interviews outlines invaluable lessons learnt."

The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related.,Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term “data science” in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as “e-science”, “e-research”, “data service”, “data curation”, “research data management” or “scientific data management” or were not present in the Web of Science database.,The paper provides the first exploration by content analysis of the field of data science from the perspective of the LIS."

The second half of the article details how labs promote the use of digital data analysis, evidence-based evaluation and ‘design-for-policy’ techniques as methods for the governing of education. In particular, they promote the ‘computational thinking’ associated with computer programming as a capacity required by a ‘reluctant state’ that is increasingly concerned to delegate its responsibilities to digitally enabled citizens with the ‘designerly’ capacities and technical expertise to ‘code’ solutions to public and social problems. Policy innovation labs are experimental laboratories trialling new methods within education for administering and governing the future of the state itself."
2ab2796390ac12df283e218907ed0ffef232dbc7,situating data science exploring how relationships to data shape learning,"The emerging field of Data Science has had a large impact on science and society. This has led to over a decade of calls to establish a corresponding field of Data Science Education. There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science—its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded—suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners’ engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline. Together, the contributions offer a vision of how the learning sciences can contribute to a more expansive, agentive and socially aware Data Science Education."

It is gaining increasing attention from a variety of domains, including education. What are the challenges of engaging with Big Data research in education? This paper identifies a wide range of critical issues that researchers need to consider when working with Big Data in education. The issues identified include diversity in the conception and meaning of Big Data in education, ontological, epistemological disparity, technical challenges, ethics and privacy, digital divide and digital dividend, lack of expertise and academic development opportunities to prepare educational researchers to leverage opportunities afforded by Big Data. The goal of this paper is to raise awareness on these issues and initiate a dialogue. The paper was inspired partly by insights drawn from the literature but mostly informed by experience researching into Big Data in education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

e2e45f4f48feed85a1f1e8465ad7384ad33ea6d7,bridging the demand and the offer in data science,"During the last several years, we have observed an exponential increase in the demand for Data Scientists in the job market. As a result, a number of trainings, courses, books, and university educational programs (both at undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate levels) have been labeled as “Big data” or “Data Science”; the fil‐rouge of each of them is the aim at forming people with the right competencies and skills to satisfy the business sector needs. In this paper, we report on some of the exercises done in analyzing current Data Science education offer and matching with the needs of the job markets to propose a scalable matching service, ie, COmpetencies ClassificatiOn (E‐CO‐2), based on Data Science techniques. The E‐CO‐2 service can help to extract relevant information from Data Science–related documents (course descriptions, job Ads, blogs, or papers), which enable the comparison of the demand and offer in the field of Data Science Education and HR management, ultimately helping to establish the profession of Data Scientist."

Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists requires multi-disciplinary approach combining wide view of the Data Science and Analytics foundation with deep practical knowledge in domain specific areas. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training.

7c614fe86cc11c0430dd12b44e018e16e5dcf742,a guide to teaching data science,"ABSTRACT Demand for data science education is surging and traditional courses offered by statistics departments are not meeting the needs of those seeking training. This has led to a number of opinion pieces advocating for an update to the Statistics curriculum. The unifying recommendation is that computing should play a more prominent role. We strongly agree with this recommendation, but advocate the main priority is to bring applications to the forefront as proposed by Nolan and Speed in 1999. We also argue that the individuals tasked with developing data science courses should not only have statistical training, but also have experience analyzing data with the main objective of solving real-world problems. Here, we share a set of general principles and offer a detailed guide derived from our successful experience developing and teaching a graduate-level, introductory data science course centered entirely on case studies. We argue for the importance of statistical thinking, as defined by Wild and Pfannkuch in 1999 and describe how our approach teaches students three key skills needed to succeed in data science, which we refer to as creating, connecting, and computing. This guide can also be used for statisticians wanting to gain more practical knowledge about data science before embarking on teaching an introductory course. Supplementary materials for this article are available online."

ce0b7ee60920f9b37f88cab785cb8b4dc337e89f,educational data science in massive open online courses,"The current massive open online course (MOOC) euphoria is revolutionizing online education. Despite its expediency, there is considerable skepticism over various concerns. In order to resolve some of these problems, educational data science (EDS) has been used with success. MOOCs provide a wealth of information about the way in which a large number of learners interact with educational platforms and engage with the courses offered. This extensive amount of data provided by MOOCs concerning students' usage information is a gold mine for EDS. This paper aims to provide the reader with a complete and comprehensive review of the existing literature that helps us understand the application of EDS in MOOCs. The main works in this area are described and grouped by task or issue to be solved, along with the techniques used. WIREs Data Mining Knowl Discov 2017, 7:e1187. doi: 10.1002/widm.1187"

But up to now, data science is hardly an issue in German computer science education at secondary schools. For this reason, we are developing a data science curriculum for German secondary schools, which first guidelines and ideas we present in this paper. The curriculum is designed as interdisciplinary approach between maths and computer science education, with also a strong focus on societal aspects. After a brief discussion of important concepts and challenges in data science, a first draft of the curriculum and an outline of a data science course for upper secondary schools accompanying the development are presented."
dd1f93c3faae464d50d2e97c2bf4ac8d43681cb1,twinning data science with information science in schools of library and information science,"As an emerging discipline, data science represents a vital new current of school of library and information science (LIS) education. However, it remains unclear how it relates to information science within LIS schools. The purpose of this paper is to clarify this issue.,Mission statement and nature of both data science and information science are analyzed by reviewing existing work in the two disciplines and drawing DIKW hierarchy. It looks at the ways in which information science theories bring new insights and shed new light on fundamentals of data science.,Data science and information science are twin disciplines by nature. The mission, task and nature of data science are consistent with those of information science. They greatly overlap and share similar concerns. Furthermore, they can complement each other. LIS school should integrate both sciences and develop organizational ambidexterity. Information science can make unique contributions to data science research, including conception of data, data quality control, data librarianship and theory dualism. Document theory, as a promising direction of unified information science, should be introduced to data science to solve the disciplinary divide.,The results of this paper may contribute to the integration of data science and information science within LIS schools and iSchools. It has particular value for LIS school development and reform in the age of big data."
f447afeccbdb9ed5df15c44011aec9c018d4b2c4,big data and data science opportunities and challenges of ischools,"Abstract Due to the recent explosion of big data, our society has been rapidly going through digital transformation and entering a new world with numerous eye-opening developments. These new trends impact the society and future jobs, and thus student careers. At the heart of this digital transformation is data science, the discipline that makes sense of big data. With many rapidly emerging digital challenges ahead of us, this article discusses perspectives on iSchools’ opportunities and suggestions in data science education. We argue that iSchools should empower their students with “information computing” disciplines, which we define as the ability to solve problems and create values, information, and knowledge using tools in application domains. As specific approaches to enforcing information computing disciplines in data science education, we suggest the three foci of user-based, tool-based, and application-based. These three foci will serve to differentiate the data science education of iSchools from that of computer science or business schools. We present a layered Data Science Education Framework (DSEF) with building blocks that include the three pillars of data science (people, technology, and data), computational thinking, data-driven paradigms, and data science lifecycles. Data science courses built on the top of this framework should thus be executed with user-based, tool-based, and application-based approaches. This framework will help our students think about data science problems from the big picture perspective and foster appropriate problem-solving skills in conjunction with broad perspectives of data science lifecycles. We hope the DSEF discussed in this article will help fellow iSchools in their design of new data science curricula."
9c1b9598f82f9ed7d75ef1a9e627496759aa2387,data science predictive analytics and big data a revolution that will transform supply chain design and management,"We illuminate the myriad of opportunities for research where supply chain management intersects with data science, predictive analytics, and big data, collectively referred to as DPB. We show that these terms are not only becoming popular but are also relevant to supply chain research and education. Data science requires both domain knowledge and a broad set of quantitative skills, but there is a dearth of literature on the topic and many questions. We call for research on skills that are needed by SCM data scientists and discuss how such skills and domain knowledge affect the effectiveness of a SCM data scientist. Such knowledge is crucial to developing future supply chain leaders. We propose definitions of data science and predictive analytics as applied to supply chain management. We examine possible applications of DPB in practice and provide examples of research questions from these applications, as well as examples of research questions employing DPB that stem from management theories. Finally, we propose specific steps interested researchers can take to respond to our call for research on the intersection of supply chain management and DPB."
3af056b2aed8724dcddea074eb68aff6dd11c926,building the biomedical data science workforce,"This article describes efforts at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 2013 to 2016 to train a national workforce in biomedical data science. We provide an analysis of the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) training program strengths and weaknesses with an eye toward future directions aimed at any funder and potential funding recipient worldwide. The focus is on extramurally funded programs that have a national or international impact rather than the training of NIH staff, which was addressed by the NIH’s internal Data Science Workforce Development Center. From its inception, the major goal of BD2K was to narrow the gap between needed and existing biomedical data science skills. As biomedical research increasingly relies on computational, mathematical, and statistical thinking, supporting the training and education of the workforce of tomorrow requires new emphases on analytical skills. From 2013 to 2016, BD2K jump-started training in this area for all levels, from graduate students to senior researchers."

Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists currently lacks a commonly accepted, harmonized instructional model that reflects all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. The educational model and approach should also solve different aspects of the future professionals that includes both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that must be supported by corresponding education infrastructure and educational labs environment. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training. This paper discussed both aspects: building customizable Data Science curriculum for different types of learners and proposing a hybrid model for virtual labs that can combine local university facility and use cloud based Big Data and Data analytics facilities and services on demand. The proposed approach is based on using the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) developed in the EU funded Project EDISON and CYCLONE cloud automation systems being developed in another EU funded project CYCLONE."

Big data bring us the data‐driven paradigm and enlighten us to challenge new classes of problems we were not able to solve in the past. We are beginning to see the impacts of big data in every aspect of our lives and society. We need a science that can address these big data problems. Data science is a new emerging discipline that was termed to address challenges that we are facing and going to face in the big data era. Thus, education in data science is the key to success, and we need concrete strategies and approaches to better educate future data scientists. In this paper, we discuss general concepts on big data, data science, and data scientists and show the results of an extensive survey on current data science education in United States. Finally, we propose various approaches that data science education should aim to accomplish."

The education and training of Data Scientists currently lacks a commonly accepted, harmonized instructional model that reflects by design the whole lifecycle of data handling in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. This paper presents the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) that is intended to create a foundation for the Data Science profession definition. The EDSF includes the following core components: Data Science Competence Framework (CF-DS), Data Science Body of Knowledge (DS-BoK), Data Science Model Curriculum (MC-DS), and Data Science Professional profiles (DSP profiles). The MC-DS is built based on CF-DS and DS-BoK, where Learning Outcomes are defined based on CF-DS competences and Learning Units are mapped to Knowledge Units in DS-BoK. In its own turn, Learning Units are defined based on the ACM Classification of Computer Science (CCS2012) and reflect typical courses naming used by universities in their current programmes. The paper provides example how the proposed EDSF can be used for designing effective Data Science curricula and reports the experience of implementing EDSF by the Champion Universities that cooperate with the EDISON project."

As health care shifts to the community, mobile health applications add to the Big Data available. There is an evolving national action plan that includes nursing data in Big Data science, spearheaded by the University of Minnesota School of Nursing. For the past 3 years, diverse stakeholders from practice, industry, education, research, and professional organizations have collaborated through the “Nursing Knowledge: Big Data Science” conferences to create and act on recommendations for inclusion of nursing data, integrated with patient-generated, interprofessional, and contextual data. It is critical for nursing leaders to understand the value of Big Data science and the ways to standardize data and workflow processes to take advantage of newer cutting edge analytics to support analytic methods to control costs and improve patient quality and safety."

The application of data science methods to new and old business problems presents a wealth of research opportunities upon which the information systems (IS) data science community is uniquely positioned to focus. Strong demand for business data science education by both students and recruiters has also given rise to new business analytics programs, often lead by IS groups. This mission will be well served by an active business data science research within IS. While contributions by IS data science scholars are being published in the premier reference discipline journals, and although such a relationship with the reference disciplines is immensely important to maintain, it may be difficult to sustain IS data science research without a healthy presence in the leading IS journals. Furthermore, IS journals are arguably best positioned to publish research at the nexus of data science, business, and society. The objective of this editorial is to inspire a discussion on opportunities to facilitate IS data science reviewing and publication in top IS journals, and to capitalize on these opportunities effectively as a community. This discussion is based on the understanding that both writing and reviewing practices are fundamental to our ability to assess the quality of data science contributions and to draw upon and publish high-quality and impactful research. These practices also affect the potential to sustain and grow an impactful data science community. Toward that end, this editorial also hopes to initiate a discussion on sustaining and growing a data science community within IS."

Like the professionalisation of law and medicine in the past 100 years, the data science field is at the very beginning of becoming a profession - with competency standards, a code of professional conduct, specialised graduate-level curriculums, certification and licensure and self-regulation. All professions require highly specialised education and training, an ethical code, self-regulation by a professional association and certification and licensing. Data science should become a profession for the same reasons medicine and law became professions: each requires practitioners to have a specialised body of knowledge, a code of conduct and self-regulation by knowledgeable professionals to assure competency and protect the public. The data science community can follow a roadmap for how data science can be professionalised by reviewing the history of the medical and legal professions. Suggested is a seven-step process for the professionalisation of data science."

9f99ee43bbd7f6d6b2c3df13a8d745d4e91b1397,the revolution in astronomy education data science for the masses,"As our capacity to study ever-expanding domains of our science has increased (including the time domain, non-electromagnetic phenomena, magnetized plasmas, and numerous sky surveys in multiple wavebands with broad spatial coverage and unprecedented depths), so have the horizons of our understanding of the Universe been similarly expanding. This expansion is coupled to the exponential data deluge from multiple sky surveys, which have grown from gigabytes into terabytes during the past decade, and will grow from terabytes into Petabytes (even hundreds of Petabytes) in the next decade. With this increased vastness of information, there is a growing gap between our awareness of that information and our understanding of it. Training the next generation in the fine art of deriving intelligent understanding from data is needed for the success of sciences, communities, projects, agencies, businesses, and economies. This is true for both specialists (scientists) and non-specialists (everyone else: the public, educators and students, workforce). Specialists must learn and apply new data science research techniques in order to advance our understanding of the Universe. Non-specialists require information literacy skills as productive members of the 21st century workforce, integrating foundational skills for lifelong learning in a world increasingly dominated by data. We address the impact of the emerging discipline of data science on astronomy education within two contexts: formal education and lifelong learners."

Over the past two decades the field of CSE has penetrated both basic and applied research in academia, industry, and laboratories to advance discovery, optimize systems, support decision-makers, and educate the scientific and engineering workforce. Informed by centuries of theory and experiment, CSE performs computational experiments to answer questions that neither theory nor experiment alone is equipped to answer. CSE provides scientists and engineers with algorithmic inventions and software systems that transcend disciplines and scales. CSE brings the power of parallelism to bear on troves of data. Mathematics-based advanced computing has become a prevalent means of discovery and innovation in essentially all areas of science, engineering, technology, and society; and the CSE community is at the core of this transformation. However, a combination of disruptive developments-including the architectural complexity of extreme-scale computing, the data revolution and increased attention to data-driven discovery, and the specialization required to follow the applications to new frontiers-is redefining the scope and reach of the CSE endeavor. With these many current and expanding opportunities for the CSE field, there is a growing demand for CSE graduates and a need to expand CSE educational offerings. This need includes CSE programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as continuing education and professional development programs, exploiting the synergy between computational science and data science. Yet, as institutions consider new and evolving educational programs, it is essential to consider the broader research challenges and opportunities that provide the context for CSE education and workforce development."

This article explores this change specifically within the iSchool community, in which information science is a major unifying discipline. A cross-institutional analysis of data-related curricula was conducted across 65 iSchools. Results show that a majority of iSchools examined (37 out of 65, 56.9%) currently offer some form of data-related education, particularly at the master’s level, and that approximately 15% of their formal degree offerings have a data focus. Overall, iSchools have a greater emphasis on data science and big data analytics, with only a few programmes providing focused curricula in the area of digital curation. Recommendations are made for iSchools to leverage the interdisciplinary nature of information science, publish curricula and track graduate success so that iSchools may excel in educating information professionals in the data area. Future data education in iSchools may benefit from further interdisciplinary data education, including data curation curricula."

In this sense, traditional concerns over supporting the development of ‘digital literacy’ are now being usurped by concerns over citizens’ ‘data literacies’. In contrast to recent data safety and data science approaches, this article argues for a more critical form of ‘personal data literacies’ where digital data are understood as socially situated and context dependent. Drawing on the critical literacies tradition, the article outlines a range of salient socio-technical understandings of personal data generation and processing. Specifically, the article proposes a framework of ‘Personal Data Literacies’ that distinguishes five significant domains: (1) Data Identification, (2) Data Understandings, (3) Data Reflexivity, (4) Data Uses, and (5) Data Tactics. The article concludes by outlining the implications of this framework for future education and research around the area of individuals’ understandings of personal data."

To understand the state of education in the field, we studied current programs and courses offered at iSchools and other schools of Library and Information Science. Here we present an overview of the methods and results. Courses are divided into four categories: data centric, data inclusive, digital, and traditional LIS. The analysis reveals trends in LIS education for data professionals and identifies particular areas of expertise and gaps in LIS education for data professional."

It is one of today’s most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the intersection of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science. Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of data-intensive machine-learning methods can be found throughout science, technology and commerce, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including health care, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, policing, and marketing."
07d4304493c19202bb172660179734b522314b71,business intelligence and analytics education and program development a unique opportunity for the information systems discipline,"“Big Data,” huge volumes of data in both structured and unstructured forms generated by the Internet, social media, and computerized transactions, is straining our technical capacity to manage it. More importantly, the new challenge is to develop the capability to understand and interpret the burgeoning volume of data to take advantage of the opportunities it provides in many human endeavors, ranging from science to business. Data Science, and in business schools, Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A) are emerging disciplines that seek to address the demands of this new era. Big Data and BI&A present unique challenges and opportunities not only for the research community, but also for Information Systems (IS) programs at business schools. In this essay, we provide a brief overview of BI&A, speculate on the role of BI&A education in business schools, present the challenges facing IS departments, and discuss the role of IS curricula and program development, in delivering BI&A education. We contend that a new vision for the IS discipline should address these challenges."

What led our forebears to found the association? What commonalities do we still see? What insights might we glean from their experiences and observations? I will use the anniversary as a chance to reflect on where we are now and where we are headed in terms of statistical education amidst the growth of data science. Statistics is the science of learning from data. By fostering more multivariable thinking, building data-related skills, and developing simulation-based problem solving, we can help to ensure that statisticians are fully engaged in data science and the analysis of the abundance of data now available to us."

A brief background to the iSchool movement is given followed by a brief review of the data decade, which highlights key data trends from the iSchool perspective: open data and open science, big data and disciplinary data diversity. The growing emphasis on the shortage of data talent is noted and a family of data science roles identified. The paper moves on to describe three primary functions of iSchools: education, research intelligence and professional practice, which form the foundations of a new Capability Ramp Model. The model is illustrated by mini-case studies from the School of Information Sciences, University of Pittsburgh: the immersive (laboratory-based) component of two new Research Data Management and Research Data Infrastructures graduate courses, a new practice partnership with the University Library System centred on RDM, and the mapping of disciplinary data practice using the Community Capability Model Profile Tool. The paper closes with a look to the future and, based on the assertion that data is mission-critical for iSchools, some steps are proposed for the next data decade: moving data education programs into the mainstream core curriculum, adopting a translational data science perspective and strengthening engagement with the Research Data Alliance."

The participants discuss big data from all sides—from wrestling with the definition and the science behind big data, to how the iSchool is cultivating a full data lifecycle perspective with its on-campus and online program. The importance of industrial collaboration is also emphasized, in order to meet the growing demand for big data analysis. Read on for more, including a link to Syracuse iSchool's free introductory e-book on data science. Edd Dumbill: Let's start with the biggest question about big data that a lot of people are asking, which is: What is it? We have heard a lot this year, but from your point-of-view running this course, how do you break down big data? Elizabeth D. Liddy: I personally think of big data as a very large collection set of either textual or numeric data and, increasingly, image data, which can either be collected for a common purpose or it could come from very diverse sources. The clear goal is to reuse it. To look at another main point: How is it we learn from it? We now know that everything we do is monitored or tracked in some way, so not just the formal collection of data, but that data from all the social media resources, from buying habits—everything is data of some type right now. The point is, no matter if you are in industry, a government agency, a hospital, or a school—there are things we can learn from data. My goal with big data is to learn something to improve the next version of whatever it is we are doing. Edd Dumbill: Jeff, I wonder if you can give an overview of what you mean by data science? Jeff Stanton: I think about data science as three really large areas. The first one that people identify most closely with data science, particularly in industry discussions, is the analytics component. I keep visualization in that same bucket. Ana-lytics and visualization are ways of taking data that you may have and that you may have cleaned and turning it into something that is actionable—turning it into conclusions. Analytics is just one area though. There are two other big areas that figure in, and one is the infrastructure. If you imagine data that is used in industry, it often begins with point-of-sale systems …"

Many people who currently teach data science are practitioners such as computational researchers in academia or data scientists in industry. To understand how these practitioner-instructors pass their knowledge onto novices and how that contrasts with teaching more traditional forms of programming, we interviewed 20 data scientists who teach in settings ranging from small-group workshops to large online courses. We found that: 1) they must empathize with a diverse array of student backgrounds and expectations, 2) they teach technical workflows that integrate authentic practices surrounding code, data, and communication, 3) they face challenges involving authenticity versus abstraction in software setup, finding and curating pedagogically-relevant datasets, and acclimating students to live with uncertainty in data analysis. These findings can point the way toward better tools for data science education and help bring data literacy to more people around the world."

Purpose
Data science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years. This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.


Design/methodology/approach
Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective?


Findings
The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences.


Research limitations/implications
The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term “data science” in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as “e-science,” “e-research,” “data service,” “data curation” or “research data management.”


Originality/value
The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals.

61b3ce156347a7f107df75924a45f81f12a0ef14,surgical data science the new knowledge domain,"Abstract Healthcare in general, and surgery/interventional care in particular, is evolving through rapid advances in technology and increasing complexity of care, with the goal of maximizing the quality and value of care. Whereas innovations in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies have driven past improvements in the quality of surgical care, future transformation in care will be enabled by data. Conventional methodologies, such as registry studies, are limited in their scope for discovery and research, extent and complexity of data, breadth of analytical techniques, and translation or integration of research findings into patient care. We foresee the emergence of surgical/interventional data science (SDS) as a key element to addressing these limitations and creating a sustainable path toward evidence-based improvement of interventional healthcare pathways. SDS will create tools to measure, model, and quantify the pathways or processes within the context of patient health states or outcomes and use information gained to inform healthcare decisions, guidelines, best practices, policy, and training, thereby improving the safety and quality of healthcare and its value. Data are pervasive throughout the surgical care pathway; thus, SDS can impact various aspects of care, including prevention, diagnosis, intervention, or postoperative recovery. The existing literature already provides preliminary results, suggesting how a data science approach to surgical decision-making could more accurately predict severe complications using complex data from preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative contexts, how it could support intraoperative decision-making using both existing knowledge and continuous data streams throughout the surgical care pathway, and how it could enable effective collaboration between human care providers and intelligent technologies. In addition, SDS is poised to play a central role in surgical education, for example, through objective assessments, automated virtual coaching, and robot-assisted active learning of surgical skill. However, the potential for transforming surgical care and training through SDS may only be realized through a cultural shift that not only institutionalizes technology to seamlessly capture data but also assimilates individuals with expertise in data science into clinical research teams. Furthermore, collaboration with industry partners from the inception of the discovery process promotes optimal design of data products as well as their efficient translation and commercialization. As surgery continues to evolve through advances in technology that enhance delivery of care, SDS represents a new knowledge domain to engineer surgical care of the future."

Digital traces of student behavior promise more scalable and finer-grained understanding and support of learning processes, which were previously too costly to obtain with traditional data sources and methodologies. This synthetic review describes the affordances and applications of microlevel (e.g., clickstream data), mesolevel (e.g., text data), and macrolevel (e.g., institutional data) big data. For instance, clickstream data are often used to operationalize and understand knowledge, cognitive strategies, and behavioral processes in order to personalize and enhance instruction and learning. Corpora of student writing are often analyzed with natural language processing techniques to relate linguistic features to cognitive, social, behavioral, and affective processes. Institutional data are often used to improve student and administrational decision making through course guidance systems and early-warning systems. Furthermore, this chapter outlines current challenges of accessing, analyzing, and using big data. Such challenges include balancing data privacy and protection with data sharing and research, training researchers in educational data science methodologies, and navigating the tensions between explanation and prediction. We argue that addressing these challenges is worthwhile given the potential benefits of mining big data in education."
d2a595c5efb4b26245c4353d5d85cbe6c7ecac0f,machine learning for datadriven discovery in solid earth geoscience,"Automating geoscience analysis Solid Earth geoscience is a field that has very large set of observations, which are ideal for analysis with machine-learning methods. Bergen et al. review how these methods can be applied to solid Earth datasets. Adopting machine-learning techniques is important for extracting information and for understanding the increasing amount of complex data collected in the geosciences. Science, this issue p. eaau0323 BACKGROUND The solid Earth, oceans, and atmosphere together form a complex interacting geosystem. Processes relevant to understanding Earth’s geosystem behavior range in spatial scale from the atomic to the planetary, and in temporal scale from milliseconds to billions of years. Physical, chemical, and biological processes interact and have substantial influence on this complex geosystem, and humans interact with it in ways that are increasingly consequential to the future of both the natural world and civilization as the finiteness of Earth becomes increasingly apparent and limits on available energy, mineral resources, and fresh water increasingly affect the human condition. Earth is subject to a variety of geohazards that are poorly understood, yet increasingly impactful as our exposure grows through increasing urbanization, particularly in hazard-prone areas. We have a fundamental need to develop the best possible predictive understanding of how the geosystem works, and that understanding must be informed by both the present and the deep past. This understanding will come through the analysis of increasingly large geo-datasets and from computationally intensive simulations, often connected through inverse problems. Geoscientists are faced with the challenge of extracting as much useful information as possible and gaining new insights from these data, simulations, and the interplay between the two. Techniques from the rapidly evolving field of machine learning (ML) will play a key role in this effort. ADVANCES The confluence of ultrafast computers with large memory, rapid progress in ML algorithms, and the ready availability of large datasets place geoscience at the threshold of dramatic progress. We anticipate that this progress will come from the application of ML across three categories of research effort: (i) automation to perform a complex prediction task that cannot easily be described by a set of explicit commands; (ii) modeling and inverse problems to create a representation that approximates numerical simulations or captures relationships; and (iii) discovery to reveal new and often unanticipated patterns, structures, or relationships. Examples of automation include geologic mapping using remote-sensing data, characterizing the topology of fracture systems to model subsurface transport, and classifying volcanic ash particles to infer eruptive mechanism. Examples of modeling include approximating the viscoelastic response for complex rheology, determining wave speed models directly from tomographic data, and classifying diverse seismic events. Examples of discovery include predicting laboratory slip events using observations of acoustic emissions, detecting weak earthquake signals using similarity search, and determining the connectivity of subsurface reservoirs using groundwater tracer observations. OUTLOOK The use of ML in solid Earth geosciences is growing rapidly, but is still in its early stages and making uneven progress. Much remains to be done with existing datasets from long-standing data sources, which in many cases are largely unexplored. Newer, unconventional data sources such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fiber-optic sensing, and crowd-sourced measurements may demand new approaches through both the volume and the character of information that they present. Practical steps could accelerate and broaden the use of ML in the geosciences. Wider adoption of open-science principles such as open source code, open data, and open access will better position the solid Earth community to take advantage of rapid developments in ML and artificial intelligence. Benchmark datasets and challenge problems have played an important role in driving progress in artificial intelligence research by enabling rigorous performance comparison and could play a similar role in the geosciences. Testing on high-quality datasets produces better models, and benchmark datasets make these data widely available to the research community. They also help recruit expertise from allied disciplines. Close collaboration between geoscientists and ML researchers will aid in making quick progress in ML geoscience applications. Extracting maximum value from geoscientific data will require new approaches for combining data-driven methods, physical modeling, and algorithms capable of learning with limited, weak, or biased labels. Funding opportunities that target the intersection of these disciplines, as well as a greater component of data science and ML education in the geosciences, could help bring this effort to fruition. Digital geology. Digital representation of the geology of the conterminous United States. [Geology of the Conterminous United States at 1:2,500,000 scale; a digital representation of the 1974 P. B. King and H. M. Beikman map by P. G. Schruben, R. E. Arndt, W. J. Bawiec] The list of author affiliations is available in the full article online. Understanding the behavior of Earth through the diverse fields of the solid Earth geosciences is an increasingly important task. It is made challenging by the complex, interacting, and multiscale processes needed to understand Earth’s behavior and by the inaccessibility of nearly all of Earth’s subsurface to direct observation. Substantial increases in data availability and in the increasingly realistic character of computer simulations hold promise for accelerating progress, but developing a deeper understanding based on these capabilities is itself challenging. Machine learning will play a key role in this effort. We review the state of the field and make recommendations for how progress might be broadened and accelerated."
7952f2e3eaf08e7f5fce98bdff64fc619bb67eb5,scientific training in the era of big data a new pedagogy for graduate education,"The era of ""big data"" has radically altered the way scientific research is conducted and new knowledge is discovered. Indeed, the scientific method is rapidly being complemented and even replaced in some fields by data-driven approaches to knowledge discovery. This paradigm shift is sometimes referred to as the ""fourth paradigm"" of data-intensive and data-enabled scientific discovery. Interdisciplinary research with a hard emphasis on translational outcomes is becoming the norm in all large-scale scientific endeavors. Yet, graduate education remains largely focused on individual achievement within a single scientific domain, with little training in team-based, interdisciplinary data-oriented approaches designed to translate scientific data into new solutions to today's critical challenges. In this article, we propose a new pedagogy for graduate education: data-centered learning for the domain-data scientist. Our approach is based on four tenets: (1) Graduate training must incorporate interdisciplinary training that couples the domain sciences with data science. (2) Graduate training must prepare students for work in data-enabled research teams. (3) Graduate training must include education in teaming and leadership skills for the data scientist. (4) Graduate training must provide experiential training through academic/industry practicums and internships. We emphasize that this approach is distinct from today's graduate training, which offers training in either data science or a domain science (e.g., biology, sociology, political science, economics, and medicine), but does not integrate the two within a single curriculum designed to prepare the next generation of domain-data scientists. We are in the process of implementing the proposed pedagogy through the development of a new graduate curriculum based on the above four tenets, and we describe herein our strategy, progress, and lessons learned. While our pedagogy was developed in the context of graduate education, the general approach of data-centered learning can and should be applied to students and professionals at any stage of their education, including at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels. We believe that the time is right to embed data-centered learning within our educational system and, thus, generate the talent required to fully harness the potential of big data."
f43507936dd71d7b91e473737de5fbee23c1b5c8,hess opinions incubating deeplearningpowered hydrologic science advances as a community,"Abstract. Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a revolutionary and versatile tool transforming industry applications and generating new and improved capabilities for scientific discovery and model building. The adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DL-based methods can open up a complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration. The area of hydrologic DL presents numerous research opportunities that could, in turn, stimulate advances in machine learning as well."

Unfortunately, data scientists with the analytical and software engineering skills to analyze these large data sets have been hard to come by; only recently have software companies started to develop competencies in software-oriented data analytics. To understand this emerging role, we interviewed data scientists across several product groups at Microsoft. In this paper, we describe their education and training background, their missions in software engineering contexts, and the type of problems on which they work. We identify five distinct working styles of data scientists: (1) Insight Providers, who work with engineers to collect the data needed to inform decisions that managers make; (2) Modeling Specialists, who use their machine learning expertise to build predictive models; (3) Platform Builders, who create data platforms, balancing both engineering and data analysis concerns; (4) Polymaths, who do all data science activities themselves; and (5) Team Leaders, who run teams of data scientists and spread best practices. We further describe a set of strategies that they employ to increase the impact and actionability of their work."

It examines how software-mediated methods intervene in the ways educational institutions and actors are seen, known and acted upon through an analysis of the methodological complex of Pearson Education’s Learning Curve data-bank and its Center for Digital Data, Analytics and Adaptive Learning. This calls for critical attention to the ‘social life’ of its methods in terms of their historical, technical and methodological provenance; their affordances to generate data for circulation within the institutional circuitry of Pearson and to its wider social networks; their capacity to configure research users’ interpretations; and their generativity to produce the knowledge to influence education policy decisions and pedagogic practices. The purpose of the article is to critically survey the digital methods being mobilized by Pearson to generate educational data, and to examine how its methodological complex acts to produce a new data-based knowledge infrastructure for education. The consequence of this shift to data-based forms of digital education governance by Pearson is a challenge to the legitimacy of the social sciences in the theorization and understanding of learning, and its displacement to the authority of the data sciences."

This overview article explores the implications of big data in education, focusing by way of example on data generated by student writing. We have chosen writing because it presents particular complexities, highlighting the range of processes for collecting and interpreting evidence of learning in the era of computer-mediated instruction and assessment as well as the challenges. Writing is significant not only because it is central to the core subject area of literacy; it is also an ideal medium for the representation of deep disciplinary knowledge across a number of subject areas. After defining what big data entails in education, we map emerging sources of evidence of learning that separately and together have the potential to generate unprecedented amounts of data: machine assessments, structured data embedded in learning, and unstructured data collected incidental to learning activity. Our case is that these emerging sources of evidence of learning have significant implications for the traditional relationships between assessment and instruction. Moreover, for educational researchers, these data are in some senses quite different from traditional evidentiary sources, and this raises a number of methodological questions. The final part of the article discusses implications for practice in an emerging field of education data science, including publication of data, data standards, and research ethics."

While our approach is substantially informed by both higher education and K-12 settings, this framework is developed to apply across all educational contexts where digital data are used to inform learners and the management of learning. Although we can identify movements that are relatively independent of each other today, we believe they will in all cases expand from their current margins to encompass larger domains and increasingly overlap. The growth in these analytic activities leads to the need to find ways to synthesize understandings, find common language, and develop frames of reference to help these movements develop into a field."
a7c7f3b80e37e0b61d8abc8af8db991f4b0ea190,insights into pathogenic interactions among environment host and tumor at the crossroads of molecular pathology and epidemiology,"Evidence indicates that diet, nutrition, lifestyle, the environment, the microbiome, and other exogenous factors have pathogenic roles and also influence the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of tumor and nonneoplastic cells, including immune cells. With the need for big-data research, pathology must transform to integrate data science fields, including epidemiology, biostatistics, and bioinformatics. The research framework of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) demonstrates the strengths of such an interdisciplinary integration, having been used to study breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. The MPE research paradigm not only can provide novel insights into interactions among environment, tumor, and host but also opens new research frontiers. New developments-such as computational digital pathology, systems biology, artificial intelligence, and in vivo pathology technologies-will further transform pathology and MPE. Although it is necessary to address the rarity of transdisciplinary education and training programs, MPE provides an exemplary model of integrative scientific approaches and contributes to advancements in precision medicine, therapy, and prevention."

Applications will speak to a range of issues of major concern to intelligence agencies, from military operations to climate change to cyber security. There are challenges too: procurement lags, data stovepiping, separating signal from noise, sources and methods, a range of normative issues, and central to managing these challenges, human capital. These potential applications and challenges are discussed and a closer look at what data scientists do in the Intelligence Community (IC) is offered. Effectively filling the ranks of the IC’s data science workforce will depend on the provision of well-trained data scientists from the higher education system. Program offerings at America’s top fifty universities will thus be surveyed (just a few years ago there were reportedly no degrees in data science). One Master’s program that has melded data science with intelligence is examined as well as a university big data research center focused on security and intelligence. This discussion goes a long way to clarify the prospective uses of data science in intelligence while probing perhaps the key challenge to optimal application of big data in the IC.

This results in the unification of analytical methodologies, and of observed and empirical data contexts. Given the dynamic nature of convergence, the origins and many evolutions of the Data Science theme are described. The following are covered in this article: the rapidly growing post-graduate university course provisioning for Data Science; a preliminary study of employability requirements, and how past eminent work in the social sciences and other areas, certainly mathematics, can be of immediate and direct relevance and benefit for innovative methodology, and for facing and addressing the ethical aspect of Big Data analytics, relating to data aggregation and scale effects. Associated also with Data Science is how direct and indirect outcomes and consequences of Data Science include decision support and policy making, and both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes. For such reasons, the importance is noted of how Data Science builds collaboratively on other domains, potentially with innovative methodologies and practice. Further sections point towards some of the most major current research issues."

In a scholarly context, the main drivers for using these containers are transparency and support of reproducibility; in turn, a workflow’s reproducibility can be greatly affected by the choices that are made with respect to building containers. In many cases, the build process for the container’s image is created from instructions provided in a Dockerfile format. In support of this approach, we present a set of rules to help researchers write understandable Dockerfiles for typical data science workflows. By following the rules in this article, researchers can create containers suitable for sharing with fellow scientists, for including in scholarly communication such as education or scientific papers, and for effective and sustainable personal workflows."

Since an educator's interpretation of visualised data is essentially the construction of a narrative about student progress, we draw on the growing body of work on Data Storytelling (DS) as the inspiration for a set of enhancements that could be applied to data visualisations to improve their communicative power. We present a pilot study that explores the effectiveness of these DS elements based on educators' responses to paper prototypes. The dual purpose is understanding the contribution of each visual element for data storytelling, and the effectiveness of the enhancements when combined."

This paper presents the findings of a collaborative auto-ethnography (CAE) engaged in by a MSc Data Science teaching team based at University of Sheffield (UK) Information School where FATE/Critical Data Studies (CDS) topics have been a core part of the curriculum since 2015/16. In this paper, we adopt the CAE approach to reflect on our experiences of working at the intersection of disciplines, and our progress and future plans for integrating FATE/CDS into the curriculum. We identify a series of challenges for deeper FATE/CDS integration related to our own competencies and the wider socio-material context of Higher Education in the UK. We conclude with recommendations for ourselves and the wider FATE/CDS orientated Data Science community."
aad5d6e47d8eedf35e7dc6e4d787f26c7d3e1c99,data science education through education data an endtoend perspective,"The increasing importance of data science has created a pressing need for more trained professionals. Hence, it is necessary to design efficient education techniques to rapidly train the next generation of students. We describe a holistic approach that integrates multiple objectives within a single semester course taught at the first year level. The objectives include basic data processing techniques, statistical analysis, teamwork, and project management. We conducted a project that combined different public datasets related to the cost and quality of education in the US. Students demonstrated a high degree of involvement in this exercise as they were curious to explore data that related to their own college selection process. It is well known that it is difficult to perform a cost-quality analysis in the field of college education.We used college ranking data created by the Wall Street Journal, and combined it with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) that provided college costs and graduation data. Students worked in teams to download sections of the data from multiple sources, performed cleaning and verification, and merged the data for analysis. This taught them the values of teamwork, goal-setting, and process measurement for timely project completion.We determined that the Pearson correlation between the rank of a college and in-state tuition was −0.65 (p<0.005) for private colleges, and −0.34 (p<0.005) for public colleges. This indicates that higher ranked colleges tend to charge higher tuition. The Pearson correlation between the rank of all colleges and their graduation rates is −0.75 (p<0.005), and between rank and retention rates is −0.71 (p<0.005). Private college tuition is typically $40,000 annually, whereas public colleges cost $20,000. These figures suggest that public colleges provide good value. This has policy implications for government funding of education."

It presents an analysis of the implications of digitization and more specifically big data analytics (BDA) and data science (DS) on organizations with a special emphasis on decision-making processes and the function of managers. It argues that business schools and other educational institutions have well responded to the need to train future data scientists but have rather disregarded the question of effectively preparing future managers for the new data-driven business era.,The approach involves analysis and review of the literature.,The development of analytics skills shall not pertain to data scientists only, it must rather become an organizational cultural component shared among all employees and more specifically among decision makers: managers. In the data-driven business era, managers turn into manager-scientists who shall possess skills at the crossroad of data management, analytical/modeling techniques and tools, and business. However, the multidisciplinary nature of big data analytics and data science (BDADS) seems to collide with the dominant “functional silo design” that characterizes business schools. The scope and breadth of the radical digitally enabled change, the author are facing, may necessitate a global questioning about the nature and structure of business education.,For the sake of transparency and clarity, academia and the industry must join forces to standardize the meaning of the terms surrounding big data. BDA/DS training programs, courses, and curricula shall be organized in such a way that students shall interact with an array of specialists providing them a broad enough picture of the big data landscape. The multidisciplinary nature of analytics and DS necessitates to revisit pedagogical models by developing experiential learning and implementing a spiral-shaped pedagogical approach. The attention of scholars is needed as there exists an array of unexplored research territories. This investigation will help bridge the gap between education and the industry.,The findings will help practitioners understand the educational challenges triggered by the advent of the data-driven business era. The implications will also help develop effective trainings and pedagogical strategies that are better suited to prepare future professionals for the new data-driven business world.,By demonstrating how the advent of a data-driven business era is impacting the function and role of managers, the paper initiates a debate revolving around the question about how business schools and higher education shall evolve to better tackle the educational challenges associated with BDADS training. Elements of response and recommendations are then provided."

Education data scientists, learning engineers and precision education specialists are new experts in knowledge production in educational research. By bringing together data science methodologies and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems with disciplinary expertise from the psychological, biological and brain sciences, they are building a new field of AI-based learning science. This article presents an examination of how education research is being remade as an experimental data-intensive science. AI is combining with learning science in new ‘digital laboratories’ where ownership over data, and power and authority over educational knowledge production, are being redistributed to research assemblages of computational machines and scientific expertise."
8f274645bb074bd533b4d83fc1652b05dcef3c95,learning health systems need to bridge the two cultures of clinical informatics and data science,"Background UK health research policy and plans for population health management are predicated upon transformative knowledge discovery from operational ‘Big Data’. Learning health systems require not only data, but feedback loops of knowledge into changed practice. This depends on knowledge management and application, which in turn depends upon effective system design and implementation. Biomedical informatics is the interdisciplinary field at the intersection of health science, social science and information science and technology that spans this entire scope. Issues In the UK, the separate worlds of health data science (bioinformatics, ‘Big Data’) and effective healthcare system design and implementation (clinical informatics, ‘Digital Health’) have operated as ‘two cultures’. Much National Health Service and social care data is of very poor quality. Substantial research funding is wasted on ‘data cleansing’ or by producing very weak evidence. There is not yet a sufficiently powerful professional community or evidence base of best practice to influence the practitioner community or the digital health industry. Recommendation The UK needs increased clinical informatics research and education capacity and capability at much greater scale and ambition to be able to meet policy expectations, address the fundamental gaps in the discipline’s evidence base and mitigate the absence of regulation. Independent evaluation of digital health interventions should be the norm, not the exception. Conclusions Policy makers and research funders need to acknowledge the existing gap between the ‘two cultures’ and recognise that the full social and economic benefits of digital health and data science can only be realised by accepting the interdisciplinary nature of biomedical informatics and supporting a significant expansion of clinical informatics capacity and capability."

Successful data science teams in business organizations, then, need to assemble people with a variety of different skills. This is only possible at scale with clear classification and certification of skills. While such certifications and classifications are in their early days, some firms are beginning to create them, and they are beginning to emerge in professional associations as well. Ideally, universities and other education providers and certifiers of data science skills would also employ standard skill classifications to communicate the skills they intend to inculcate."

The study examines recent job descriptions and maps their requirements to the current curriculum within the graduate MLIS and Information Science and Technology Masters Programs in the School of Information Sciences (iSchool) at the University of Pittsburgh. From this mapping exercise, model ‘course pathways’ and module ‘stepping stones’ have been identified, as well as course topic gaps and opportunities for collaboration with other Schools. Competency in four specific tools or technologies was required by all three roles (Microsoft Excel, R, Python and SQL), as well as collaborative skills (with both teams of colleagues and with clients). The ability to connect the educational curriculum with real-world positions is viewed as further validation of the translational approach being developed as a foundational principle of the current MLIS curriculum review process"
47095fc11279464ca63fea0457941cce248349c8,examining spontaneous perspective taking and fluid selftodata relationships in informal openended data exploration,"Engaging learners with complex unfamiliar datasets is a known challenge in Data Science education. One promising phenomenon investigated in related work is perspective-taking. A first-person “actor” perspective can help facilitate group and individual sensemaking by mediating observations and actions taken by learners. Here we investigate how museum visitors made use of an actor perspective when exploring an open-ended, interactive data map museum exhibit. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: role-play, projection, and orientation. A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (extrapolating and noticing absence) were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., enacting, spatially characterizing, generalizing) were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships. We use these empirical findings to generate hypotheses about how APT and associated sensemaking processes may support Data Science learning goals."
acb6644c0aebd7b119257914da3091a273961994,data science approach for simulating educational data towards the development of teaching outcome model tom,"The increasing availability of educational data provides the educational researcher with numerous opportunities to use analytics to extract useful knowledge to enhance teaching and learning. While learning analytics focuses on the collection and analysis of data about students and their learning contexts, teaching analytics focuses on the analysis of the design of the teaching environment and the quality of learning activities provided to students. In this article, we propose a data science approach that incorporates the analysis and delivery of data-driven solution to explore the role of teaching analytics, without compromising issues of privacy, by creating pseudocode that simulates data to help develop test cases of teaching activities. The outcome of this approach is intended to inform the development of a teaching outcome model (TOM), that can be used to inspire and inspect quality of teaching. The simulated approach reported in the research was accomplished through Splunk. Splunk is a Big Data platform designed to collect and analyse high volumes of machine-generated data and render results on a dashboard in real-time. We present the results as a series of visual dashboards illustrating patterns, trends and results in teaching performance. Our research aims to contribute to the development of an educational data science approach to support the culture of data-informed decision making in higher education."

In this article, we question the applicability of these methods to education. In particular, we consider a case of recent attempts from data scientists to add AI elements to a handful of online learning environments, such as Khan Academy and the ASSISTments intelligent tutoring system. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies (STS), we provide a detailed examination of the scholarly work carried out by several data scientists around the use of ‘deep learning’ to predict aspects of educational performance. This approach draws attention to relations between various (problematic) units of analysis: flawed data, partially incomprehensible computational methods, narrow forms of educational’ knowledge baked into the online environments, and a reductionist discourse of data science with evident economic ramifications. These relations can be framed ethnographically as a ‘controversy’ that casts doubts on AI as an objective scientific endeavour, whilst illuminating the confusions, the disagreements and the economic interests that surround its implementations."

This paper explores the attributes of big data that are relevant to educational institutions, investigates the factors influencing adoption of big data and analytics in learning institutions and seeks to establish the limiting factors hindering use of big data in Institutions of higher learning. The study has been conducted through a desk search and reviewed sources of literature including scientific research journals and reports. The paper is based on desk research. The sources of literature that were reviewed included scientific research articles and journals, conference reports and theses. Online journals found on the internet were also examined with the search being broadened by Google Scholar where the following keywords were used “big data”, “developing countries”, “education systems” and “clustering”. The paper concludes that Big Data is important since it offers Universities opportunities to their Information Technology resources strategically to improve educational quality and guide students, colleges and universities see value in analytics; and therefore recommends that these institutions carry out investments in analytics programs and in people to have relevant data science. This is because Big Data can afford educational institutions opportunities to shape a modern and dynamic education system, in which every individual student can have the maximum benefit from, and can greatly contribute towards improving the quality of education"
3466f99ab8256a4edd9bd4ca0ab842cb11d998f8,understanding democracy and development traps using a datadriven approach,"Abstract Methods from machine learning and data science are becoming increasingly important in the social sciences, providing powerful new ways of identifying statistical relationships in large data sets. However, these relationships do not necessarily offer an understanding of the processes underlying the data. To address this problem, we have developed a method for fitting nonlinear dynamical systems models to data related to social change. Here, we use this method to investigate how countries become trapped at low levels of socioeconomic development. We identify two types of traps. The first is a democracy trap, where countries with low levels of economic growth and/or citizen education fail to develop democracy. The second trap is in terms of cultural values, where countries with low levels of democracy and/or life expectancy fail to develop emancipative values. We show that many key developing countries, including India and Egypt, lie near the border of these development traps, and we investigate the time taken for these nations to transition toward higher democracy and socioeconomic well-being."
106274c0cb6b8551fc36b75632658f382474a890,big data software engineering analysis of knowledge domains and skill sets using ldabased topic modeling,"Software engineering is a data-driven discipline and an integral part of data science. The introduction of big data systems has led to a great transformation in the architecture, methodologies, knowledge domains, and skills related to software engineering. Accordingly, education programs are now required to adapt themselves to up-to-date developments by first identifying the competencies concerning big data software engineering to meet the industrial needs and follow the latest trends. This paper aims to reveal the knowledge domains and skill sets required for big data software engineering and develop a taxonomy by mapping these competencies. A semi-automatic methodology is proposed for the semantic analysis of the textual contents of online job advertisements related to big data software engineering. This methodology uses the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a probabilistic topic-modeling technique to discover the hidden semantic structures from a given textual corpus. The output of this paper is a systematic competency map comprising the essential knowledge domains, skills, and tools for big data software engineering. The findings of this paper are expected to help evaluate and improve IT professionals’ vocational knowledge and skills, identify professional roles and competencies in personnel recruitment processes of companies, and meet the skill requirements of the industry through software engineering education programs. Additionally, the proposed model can be extended to blogs, social networks, forums, and other online communities to allow automatic identification of emerging trends and generate contextual tags."

We surveyed faculty who teach statistics or whose institutions offer statistics to business students and conducted web searches of business analytics and data science programs that are offered by these faculties associated with schools of business. The intent of the survey and web searches was to gain insight on the current landscape of business analytics and how it may work synergistically with data science at institutions of higher education, as well as inform the role that statistics education plays in the era of big data. The study presents an analysis of subject areas (Statistics, Operations Research, Management Information Systems, Data Analytics, and Soft Skills) covered in courses offered by institutions with undergraduate degrees in business analytics or data science influencing statistics taught to business students. Given the notable contribution of statistics to the study of business analytics and data science and the importance of knowledge and skills acquired in statistics-based courses not only for students pursuing a major or minor in the discipline, but also for all business majors entering the current data-centric business environment, we present findings about who is teaching what in business statistics education."

Building upon the concept of ‘learnification’, practices of ‘learning’ in emerging big data-driven environments are discussed in two significant ways: the training of machines, and the nudging of human decisions through digital choice architectures. Firstly, ‘machine learning’ is discussed as an important example of how data-driven technologies are beginning to influence educational activity, both through sophisticated technical expertise and a grounding in behavioural psychology. Secondly, we explore how educational software design informed by behavioural economics is increasingly intended to frame learner choices to influence and ‘nudge’ decisions towards optimal outcomes. Through the growing influence of ‘data science’ on education, behaviourist psychology is increasingly and powerfully invested in future educational practices. Finally, it is argued that future education may tend toward very specific forms of behavioural governance – a ‘machine behaviourism’ – entailing combinations of radical behaviourist theories and machine learning systems, that appear to work against notions of student autonomy and participation, seeking to intervene in educational conduct and shaping learner behaviour towards predefined aims."

This paper first analyzes the major areas of big data capability training and the Chinese market needs for various kinds of data science talent. Then, it discusses the curriculum design process for the “Data Science & Big Data Technology” bachelor’s degree program, and summarizes some detailed approaches to improving teaching experiments. Finally, this paper proposes a graduating student profile for big data education at applied technical colleges and universities in China. The authors’ main ideas include that, at the applied technical colleges and universities, a) a suitable graduating student orientation should be determined as the big data talent needs are hierarchical; b) the redesigned curriculum in big data education should provide students more practical capabilities and knowledge; c) the teaching of the existing mainstream big data technologies and tools should be significant components in the syllabi of big data education."

Yet-to-be-developed data science approaches have the potential to dramatically advance instruction for every student and to enhance learning for people of all ages. Next steps that emerged from a recent NSF funded Computing Research Association workshop on data-intensive research in education were: 1) mobilize communities around opportunities based on new forms of evidence, 2) infuse evidence-based decision-making throughout a system, 3) develop new forms of educational assessment, 4) re-conceptualize data generation, collection, storage, and representation processes, 5) develop new types of analytic methods, 6) build human capacity to do data science and to use its products, and 7) develop advances in privacy, security, and ethics. If these steps are taken, participants agreed that data science approaches have the potential to dramatically advance instruction for every student and to enhance learning for people of all ages. This article briefly summarizes three of these themes that are particularly relevant, yet have not received as much attention as they deserve."

We identify and speculate on the ways different ideas of life, drawing from humanities, social, life and computing sciences, may impact the ways we think about and know education policy. We focus on key aspects of education policy around self-responsibilisation and choice, new forms of network governance and the move to education data science. The paper examines what is required to understand how advancements in the life and computing sciences may be implemented within educational institutions and organisations, and what political and ethical issues might pertain to the challenges these new advancements bring to educational institutions."
445bbfe6c15ccfd13548525a539ca2adf76f5126,creating a balanced data science program,"As we consider the next fifty years of computing education, a phenomenon that shows no signs of abating is the data deluge, in which commercial companies, the natural sciences, the social sciences, professional sports teams, government agencies, and other institutions are generating ever-increasing quantities of data. To address the challenges posed by the data deluge, the discipline of data science has arisen, and an increasing number of universities are offering undergraduate data science programs. Many of these programs have their origins in a computer science or a statistics department, leading to a data science curriculum that is more heavily weighted toward computing or statistics. By contrast, the data science program described in this paper is a joint endeavor between computer science and statistics that seeks to provide balanced training in both areas. Its broad goals are to produce students who (a) are well-trained in both computer science and statistics, (b) are equipped with specialized data-related skills that are not normally taught in either of those disciplines, and (c) can apply their skills to a domain area. This paper reports on the author's experiences leading the effort to create this program, which has seen good growth, received positive feedback from students, and is successfully preparing students for internships. We offer this report in the hope that it may serve as a model for other institutions considering the addition of an undergraduate data science program."

What should be incorporated into computational science curriculum? Generating Functions (GFs) are one of the most useful tools, GFs have been playing an important role in many applications, including analysis of algorithms and in combinatorics, etc, GFs transform discrete data into continuous functions, so we can apply all the mathematical theories and methodologies for manipulating functions to study discrete data or data science. Recently, it was showed that GFs can be used beyond traditional applications in computation [1, 4, 5, 12]. So we believe it is very important to incorporate GFs into computational science education, including both traditional and new applications."

Because this goal is yet to be achieved in most countries, in particular in the developing and underdeveloped countries, it is extremely important to find more effective ways to improve education. This paper presents a model based on the application of computational intelligence (data mining and data science) that leads to the development of the student’s knowledge profile and that can help educators in their decision making for best orienting their students. This model also tries to establish key performance indicators to monitor objectives’ achievement within individual strategic planning assembled for each student. The model uses random forest for classification and prediction, graph description for data structure visualization and recommendation systems to present relevant information to stakeholders. The results presented were built based on the real dataset obtained from a Brazilian private k-9 (elementary school). The obtained results include correlations among key data, a model to predict student performance and recommendations that were generated for the stakeholders."

The Visible Thinking pedagogical framework is also suggested to achieve a good complement to traditional lecture–tutorial systems. The virtual laboratory is implemented in an open-access Java interactive software. We demonstrate a viable instruction procedure, providing a set of virtual laboratory activities with real-world applications spanning signal processing, data science and analytics, sustainable infrastructure engineering, and theoretical physics. A preliminary study on a pilot cohort indicates that the proposed virtual laboratory can enhance students’ learning.

e4eaeef9c33c84acb56b399f307aa13ecca75fe4,big data and data science in health care what nurses and midwives need to know,"“Data science”—an interdisciplinary science encompassing statistics, mathematics, engineering, computer science, informatics, and/or decision science to elicit evidence-based informed shared decision-making rationales among parties (O’Connor, 2018; Park, 2018a, 2018b)—has grown by leaps and bounds since 2016 when Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo revealed its exceptional performance beyond human capability. Further, “data science” is now evolving bi-exponentially all around the world. The leading Industry-University Collaboration initiatives for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-centered research include the institutions of (1) Google and University of Toronto (the Vector Institute), (2) Google DeepMind and University of Alberta, (3) IBM and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and (4) Microsoft and University of Montreal and are expected to promote AI’s high-speed development (Bushey, 2017), improving the process of scientific discovery and the quality of decision-making given unpredictable conditions and advancing a data‐driven economy (Ahalt et al., 2014; Park & Glenn, 2017). Such a consortium heralds that academic, economic, and sociological innovation/transformation would ensue sequentially and concurrently. Dare we dream how far science can go? The impact of these changes has not yet affected our everyday lives because these technological advances have not yet become an essential part of our lives. However, Virtual Reality (VR) developers are already almost finished constructing a real economy in several VR platforms (Park, 2018c). The AI-driven Autonomous Driving Car (ADC) is also expected to be released in 2020 (Business-Insider, 2016). By extension, Google’s Toronto smart city project will initiate its pilot program this summer, begin construction in 2020, and have its first residents by 2022 (Li, 2018). A drastic socio-structural change in our lives is already underway (Park, 2018c).  Each academic discipline is accordingly transitioning to a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)-integrated education policy and reforming the curriculum to meet the demands of the times. Such an attempt mainly focuses on providing students a wide array of methodological expertise and hands-on experience in data science through taking additional courses delivered by STEM-related departments, upon students’ request. The course content includes combining large data sets with advanced analytics, e.g., (1) data/text/opinion/reality mining, (2) descriptive statistical analytics such as data visualization, social network analysis and cluster analysis, and (3) predictive analytics such as mathematical modeling, forecasting, simulation, machine learning, and so on (O’Connor, 2018). However, we must face an inconvenient truth about students’ preparation in statistics and mathematics, the foundational subjects of data science. Above all, before teaching students computer programming with Python or R, we first need to figure out WHAT the students want to mine from the flood of data. We also need to proactively identify whether the students understand HOW to explore their intellectual curiosity. That is, a well-established pre-knowledge about the primary specialization encompassing statistics and/or mathematics is required. For example, a decision science expert whose primary major is not nursing science has inherent limits performing data analyses appropriately reflecting the nature and value of nursing care. His/her evidence may be ineffective or even dangerous to nursing practice. No matter how perfect its scientific integrity is, knowledge without a foundation in the primary science may result in invalid policy-making in nursing practice (Park, 2018b), consequently threatening patient safety. Data science requires a totally different way of thinking and working from traditional, fixed framework-oriented, statistics-based nursing science (O’Connor, 2018; Park, 2018b), indicating that creativity and originality are highly valued in the new era of science. However, most undergraduate and even graduate nursing programs do not currently have an educational system synthesizing mathematics and computer programming such as Python or R, even though statistics is relatively well-integrated in curriculums. First, a lack of competent educators in both nursing science and data science is an urgent issue. However, insufficiency of scholarly preparation in mathematics among current nurse scientists is more urgent (Park, 2017), setting back the advancement of nursing science and going against the trend. An enormous challenge lies ahead due to the demanding nature of mathematics, with its long, high-intensity training and the wide gap between/among the viewpoints of academic disciplines—i.e., the humanities/social sciences and STEM. However, we should no longer avoid such a challenge. We nurses have an obligation to keep on doing our best to satisfy the ever-changing and complex needs of our patients in order to protect them from potential harm as well as enhance patients’ well-being.

A total of 496 students (285 female, 211 male) participated using by stratified sampling method from seven high schools located in the Cappadocia Region of Turkey. While students’ science process skills were evaluated using science process skills measurement test (SPSMT) developed by Temiz (2007), cognitive styles (field dependent and independent) were determined using group embedded figures test (GEFT), developed by Witkin et al. (1977). Scores obtained for identifying manipulated, responding and controlled variables, and formulating hypotheses, manipulating variables, interpreting data science process skills were compared in terms of cognitive styles possessed by the students. As a result of this comparison, it has been observed that students with field independence were more successful than field dependent students in all science process skills examined. Results of the independent sample t-test demonstrated statistically meaningful differences in identifying responding variable, controlled variables, formulating hypotheses and manipulating variables skills.

Objective The objective of this study was to explore data collection approaches to help inform future MOOC evaluations on the use of semistructured interviews and the Kirkpatrick evaluation model. Methods A total of 191 learners joined 2 course runs of a limited trial of the MOOC. Moreover, 7 learners volunteered to be interviewed for the study. The study design drew on semistructured interviews of 2 learners transcribed and analyzed using Braun and Clark’s method for thematic coding. This limited participant set was used to identify how the Kirkpatrick evaluation model could be used to evaluate further implementations of the course at scale. Results The study identified several themes that could be used for further analysis. The themes and subthemes include learner background (educational, professional, and topic significance), MOOC learning (learning achievement and MOOC application), and MOOC features (MOOC positives, MOOC negatives, and networking). There were insufficient data points to perform a Kirkpatrick evaluation. Conclusions Semistructured interviews for MOOC evaluation can provide a valuable in-depth analysis of learners’ experience of the course. However, there must be sufficient data sources to complete a Kirkpatrick evaluation to provide for data triangulation. For example, data from precourse and postcourse surveys, quizzes, and test results could be used to improve the evaluation methodology."
0dff832d22b8bbeb4bed2564ebe62f3afe2e0b48,the theoretical and methodological opportunities afforded by guided play with young children,"For infants and young children, learning takes place all the time and everywhere. How children learn best both in and out of school has been a long-standing topic of debate in education, cognitive development, and cognitive science. Recently, guided play has been proposed as an integrative approach for thinking about learning as a child-led, adult-assisted playful activity. The interactive and dynamic nature of guided play presents theoretical and methodological challenges and opportunities. Drawing upon research from multiple disciplines, we discuss the integration of cutting-edge computational modeling and data science tools to address some of these challenges, and highlight avenues toward an empirically grounded, computationally precise and ecologically valid framework of guided play in early education."

90d200873673fba3ac44bee6136ce971f3a1d77a,computing with corgis diverse realworld datasets for introductory computing,"To successfully bring introductory computing to non-CS majors, one needs to create a curriculum that will appeal to students from diverse disciplines. Several educational theories emphasize the need for introductory contexts that align with students' long-term goals and are perceived as useful. Data Science, using algorithms to manipulate real-world data and interpreting the results, has emerged as a field with cross-disciplinary value, and has strong potential as an appealing context for introductory computing courses. However, it is not easy to find, clean, and integrate datasets that will satisfy a broad variety of learners. The CORGIS project (https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis) enables instructors to easily incorporate data science into their classroom. Specifically, it provides over 40 datasets in areas including history, politics, medicine, and education. Additionally, the CORGIS infrastructure supports the integration of new datasets with simple libraries for Java, Python, and Racket, thus empowering introductory students to write programs that manipulate real data. Finally, the CORGIS web-based tools allow learners to visualize and explore datasets without programming, enabling data science lessons on day one. We have incorporated CORGIS assignments into an introductory course for non-majors to study their impact on learners' motivation, with positive initial results. These results indicate that external adopters are likely to find the CORGIS tools and materials useful in their own pedagogical pursuits."
6120cef536eaa323822714329fab4c0c191995e9,realizing the potential of digital development the case of agricultural advice,"Mobile farming advice Mobile phones are almost universally available, and the costs of information transmission are low. They are used by smallholder farmers in low-income countries, largely successfully, to optimize markets for their produce. Fabregas et al. review the potential for boosting mobile phone use with smartphones to deliver not only market information but also more sophisticated agricultural extension advice. GPS-linked smartphones could provide locally relevant weather and pest information and video-based farming advice. But how to support the financial requirements of such extension services is less obvious, given the unwieldiness of government agencies and the vested interests of commercial suppliers. Science, this issue p. eaay3038 BACKGROUND Sustainably raising agricultural productivity for the 2 billion people living in smallholder farming households in the developing world is critical for reducing world poverty and meeting rising food demand in the face of climate change. Nevertheless, most smallholder farmers have no access to science-based agricultural advice. The widespread adoption of basic mobile phone technology presents opportunities to improve upon existing in-person agricultural extension efforts that are expensive and fraught with accountability problems. ADVANCES Meta-analyses suggest that the transmission of agricultural information through mobile technologies in sub-Saharan Africa and India increased yields by 4% and the odds of adoption of recommended agrochemical inputs by 22%. The delivery of market information can have additional system-wide impacts, reducing price dispersion and lowering transaction costs. Given the low and rapidly declining cost of information transmission, benefits likely exceed costs by an order of magnitude. Even basic phones and inexpensive text and voice messages can influence farmer behavior. Smartphones with GPS systems create the potential for larger gains through the transmission of more sophisticated media, such as videos, and for locally customized information on soil characteristics, weather, and pest outbreaks, delivered at the appropriate time during the agricultural season. Messages could be customized on the basis of farmer characteristics, such as education or financial circumstances. Experimentation, machine learning, and two-way communication with and between farmers could facilitate improvements of information and other services over time. Advances from behavioral science can improve information transmission and address behavioral barriers to the adoption of improved agricultural techniques. Mobile phone–based systems could increase the productivity and accountability of in-person extension agents and enhance supply chain functionality. Realizing the potential of digital agriculture will require an interdisciplinary effort to develop and rigorously test a variety of approaches, incorporating insights from behavioral science, agriculture, economics, and data science. OUTLOOK Multiple market failures associated with information markets limit the ability of mobile phone–based extension systems to reach socially efficient scale through purely commercial financing. Because the marginal costs of disseminating information are close to zero, the optimal scale of such systems is very large. However, fixed system development costs still must be covered. Multiple organizations have introduced digital agricultural extension systems with financial models based on selling subscriptions to individual farmers, but such systems have been able to reach only a small fraction of farmers in the developing world. Farmer payments may be insufficient to cover the fixed costs, because information is difficult to exclude from nonpurchasers and because it is challenging for farmers to verify the quality of the information. Existing evidence suggests substantial gaps between farmers’ willingness to pay for information and its social value. Advertising or agrochemical input sales could be used to finance information provision, but this approach could incentivize providers to distort information content in the absence of strong reputational costs of misinformation or appropriate regulation. Public financing could cover fixed costs and enable scale-up. Although agriculture ministries often deliver messages in ways that farmers find difficult to understand and use, recent examples suggest that if feedback mechanisms are in place, governments can improve their services over time. Models that incentivize farmers to share their experiences create scope for customization and efficiency gains as systems grow, because this data may be used to improve recommendations for other farmers. If successful, digital agricultural advisory systems could supply a model for digital development more broadly. Mobile phones can benefit farmers in low- and middle-income countries by improving access to agricultural advice and market price information. Mobile technologies, particularly smartphones, have the potential to bring sophisticated science-based agricultural advice to smallholder farmers to improve productivity, especially under rapidly changing economic and environmental conditions. However, market failures likely preclude efficient scaling of valuable digital advice applications. PHOTO: JAKE LYELL/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO The rapid spread of mobile phones creates potential for sustainably raising agricultural productivity for the 2 billion people living in smallholder farming households. Meta-analyses suggest that providing agricultural information via digital technologies increased yields by 4% and the odds of adopting recommended inputs by 22%. Benefits likely exceed the cost of information transmission by an order of magnitude. The spread of GPS-enabled smartphones could increase these benefits by enabling customized information, thus incentivizing farmers to contribute information to the system. Well-known distortions in markets for information limit the ability of such systems to reach the socially efficient scale through purely commercial means. There is a clear role for public support for digital agricultural extension, but messages designed by agricultural ministries are often difficult for farmers to understand and use. Realizing the potential of mobile communication systems requires feedback mechanisms to enable rigorous testing and continuous improvement."

Application of computer technology, mathematical methods and models, statistical analysis in the study process for economics students became routine long time ago, then why is Data Science linked mostly only to the faculties of information technologies? The specificity of economic professions requires the acquisition of skills in the work with large data sets, qualitative evaluation of statistics, predicting a large number of economic phenomena, so the economist of the future should be not only a specialist in the main subject area, but also a specialist in Big Data and Data Mining. The study outlines the underlying background for essential changes. The article analyzes relevant educational and professional programs, blocks of disciplines, providing qualitative assimilation of new information by students and acquisition of those abilities and skills that are needed by the modern specialist in the field of economy and will form student as a serious competitor in the labor market. It has been conducted the analysis of modern international commercial on-line courses, specifying the topics and aspects necessary for the future economics graduates. The logical scheme of Data Science specialties introduction which follows the relevant cycle of the existing disciplines of general and professional training is proposed. Mastering the knowledge of qualitative data analysis and tools for optimal work with them should be one of the main tasks of the methodological system of education and research at the faculties of economics. Modern educational technologies and scientific facilities of universities should help to expand the understanding and perception of the economist, marketologist, and manager profession, because the digital advertising, SMM, social networks, online applications, project management, State in a Smartphone, and other rapid transformations encourage to train not classic specialists, but universals who will be able to adapt quickly to the needs of the future."
77873070c08adac77b7cc58c55cb98e93c198d8d,adaptively selecting occupations to detect skill shortages from online job ads,"Labour demand and skill shortages have historically been difficult to assess given the high costs of conducting representative surveys and the inherent delays of these indicators. This is particularly consequential for fast developing skills and occupations, such as those relating to Data Science and Analytics (DSA). This paper develops a data-driven solution to detecting skill shortages from online job advertisements (ads) data. We first propose a method to generate sets of highly similar skills based on a set of seed skills from job ads. This provides researchers with a novel method to adaptively select occupations based on granular skills data. Next, we apply this adaptive skills similarity technique to a dataset of over 6.7 million Australian job ads in order to identify occupations with the highest proportions of DSA skills. This uncovers 306,577 DSA job ads across 23 occupational classes from 2012-2019. Finally, we propose five variables for detecting skill shortages from online job ads: (1) posting frequency; (2) salary levels; (3) education requirements; (4) experience demands; and (5) job ad posting predictability. This contributes further evidence to the goal of detecting skills shortages in real-time. In conducting this analysis, we also find strong evidence of skills shortages in Australia for highly technical DSA skills and occupations. These results provide insights to Data Science researchers, educators, and policy-makers from other advanced economies about the types of skills that should be cultivated to meet growing DSA labour demands in the future."

While these topics are interesting in their own right, perhaps the most compelling aspect of these fields is how the tools, which are in widespread use, have been developed by an Open Source community. Individuals across several universities and companies have worked together in a distributed fashion to build and improve the leading generation of data technologies. These Open Source principles have enabled the latest industry-adopted tools to constantly evolve at an incredible rate. One way for educators to keep pace with these developments and maintain advanced curriculum is to adopt the same collaborative principles used in open source. At the Insight Data Fellowship, we've used this open source model to provide immediate feedback and drive our curriculum forward, while fostering a culture of independence and curiosity. This session will show Engineering educators how to use open source principles and tools to develop their own curriculum."

Several initiatives are underway to aggregate and mobilize these biodiversity, environmental, and ecological data resources (iDigBio, NEON, GBIF, iNaturalist, etc.). This requires a new set of skills for the 21st century biodiversity scientist; who is required to be fluent in integrative fields spanning evolutionary biology, systematics, ecology, geology, and environmental science and possess the quantitative, computational, and data skills to conduct research using large and complex datasets. The biodiversity science community has recognized a need to unite biodiversity and data sciences and improve data literacy in the emerging science workforce. The NSF-funded Biodiversity Literacy in Undergraduate Education (BLUE; biodiversityliteracy.com) is working to bridge a gap between efforts that currently exists to promote data literacy pre-college and professional development for those pursuing careers in biodiversity science. The BLUE network is developing strategies and materials to infuse biodiversity data into the core of the undergraduate science curriculum, facilitating broad-scale adoption of biodiversity data literacy competencies, and improving undergraduate biology training to meet increasing workforce demands in data and biodiversity sciences. The BLUE network has four major goals: 1) Cultivate a diverse and inclusive network of biodiversity researchers, data scientists, and biology educators focused on undergraduate data-centric biodiversity education; 2) build community consensus on core biodiversity data literacy competencies; 3) develop strategies and exemplar materials to guide the integration of biodiversity data literacy competencies into introductory undergraduate biology curricula; and 4) extend the network to engage a broader community of undergraduate educators in biodiversity data literacy efforts.
 The BLUE community continues to grow and build new partnerships and initiatives across the biodiversity science community. In year two of the BLUE network we have been focusing efforts building the community, developing and disseminating exemplar educational materials, and defining core biodiversity data literacy skills and competencies. We will present our current and ongoing work and ways in which members of the biodiversity_next community can be involved in shaping the biodiversity science of the future, while addressing the needs of a changing planet."

This poster presents core design principles devised by the authors to build a data science curriculum foregrounding ethics and valuing creative human capacities alongside strong data analytic skills. The curriculum design transforms human‐centered principles into practice. The poster visually illustrates the trajectory of these principles in relation to three specific graduate attributes, using a selection of deep dives into the learning design. To illustrate the specific power information theory and practice has to shape data science training, the poster uses evocative quotes from information science theorists and displays how their work significantly influenced the overall philosophy of the program, student activities and assessments. Using ‘gamestorming’ techniques during the poster session, the audience is invited to contribute further insights about ways to nurture the deeply human capacities of the data scientists we train."

Data science as a discipline potentially offers a wealth of jobs to prospective employees, while traditional information science-based roles continue to decrease as budgets get cut across the U.S. Since data is related closely to information historically, this research will explore the education of U.S. iSchool professionals and compare it to traditional data science roles being advertised within the job market. Through a combination of latent semantic analysis of over 1600 job postings and iSchool course documentation, it is our aim to explore the intersection of library and information science and data science. Hopefully these research findings will guide future directions for library and information science professionals into data science driven roles, while also examining and highlighting the data science techniques currently driven by the education of iSchool professionals. In addition, it is our aim to understand how data science could benefit from a mutually symbiotic relationship with the field of information science as statistically data scientists spend far too much time working on data preparation and not nearly enough time conducting scientific inquiry. The results of this examination will potentially guide future directions of iSchool students and professionals towards more cooperative data science roles and guide future research into the intersection between iSchools and data science and possibilities for partnership."

Youth represented family decision-making and social conditions that might have motivated family movements with online, dynamic data modeling and mapping tools (Gapminder.org; SocialExplorer.com). The qualitative video analysis examined participants’ experiences and learning in storytelling and modeling the family geobiography, focusing on multimodal talk-in-interaction to understand how the study design engaged learners’ capacities, histories, and imagined futures in relation to the LSDS and supported learning about oneself and society. Grounded examples from two family cases are used to illustrate how participants placed their families and selves into data ontologies and the role of family members in composing storylines."
d86680d6a358feccbbe007fc853b20144852d10e,scaling up introducing undergraduates to data science early in their college careers,"It has historically been the case that most data science and analytics programs are offered at the Master of Science level. What few undergraduate offerings exist are frequently limited to either a standalone course or a small number of courses targeted to upper level undergraduates. Literature on how best to teach data science to undergraduate students is practically nonexistent. We review recent work on establishing standards and learning objectives for undergraduate data science education, and we make the case that undergraduate students should be exposed to data science early in their college career. We describe the strategy used to teach an introductory course in data science aimed not at upper-level students, but at undergraduate students in their first or second year of study. This course assumes no prerequisite knowledge in computing, mathematics, or statistics, aligns well with recently outlined objectives for undergraduate data science education, and has a track record of success for five consecutive semesters."
c220add8114ea526a388d497fb645c0e6baba2a6,smarter learning software education and the big data imaginary,"Big data and smarter learning software systems are beginning to impact on education, particularly within the schools sector. This paper traces the emergence of a ‘big data imaginary,’ a vision of a desirable future of education that its advocates believe is attainable through the application of big data technologies and practices. Firstly, it identifies a ‘first wave of big data’ in nineteenth-century education exhibitions and its continuities with the visualization of large-scale educational data today. Secondly, it details the emergence of ‘educational data science’ as an exemplar of how ‘second wave big data’ has entered the imagination of many actors within education. Thirdly, it then demonstrates how education is being reimagined in relation to ‘smart cities’ that depend on big data for their functioning, before fourthly detailing the recent appearance of ‘startup schools’ that are being established by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to run as testbeds of smarter learning software systems. A concluding section discusses how the future of education may be governed by the production and circulation of the ‘data and algorithms of the powerful.’"
6066b6db2b03e1ac97d2d1a2258142659254ae3a,are we ready to integrate artificial intelligence literacy into medical school curriculum students and faculty survey,"Background: The effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology applications are already felt in healthcare in general and in the practice of medicine in the disciplines of radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and oncology. The expanding interface between digital data science, emerging AI technologies and healthcare is creating a demand for AI technology literacy in health professions. Objective: To assess medical student and faculty attitudes toward AI, in preparation for teaching AI foundations and data science applications in clinical practice in an integrated medical education curriculum. Methods: An online 15-question semi-structured survey was distributed among medical students and faculty. The questionnaire consisted of 3 parts: participant’s background, AI awareness, and attitudes toward AI applications in medicine. Results: A total of 121 medical students and 52 clinical faculty completed the survey. Only 30% of students and 50% of faculty responded that they were aware of AI topics in medicine. The majority of students (72%) and faculty (59%) learned about AI from the media. Faculty were more likely to report that they did not have a basic understanding of AI technologies (χ2, P = .031). Students were more interested in AI in patient care training, while faculty were more interested in AI in teaching training (χ2, P = .001). Additionally, students and faculty reported comparable attitudes toward AI, limited AI literacy and time constraints in the curriculum. There is interest in broad and deep AI topics. Our findings in medical learners and teaching faculty parallel other published professional groups’ AI survey results. Conclusions: The survey conclusively proved interest among medical students and faculty in AI technology in general, and in its applications in healthcare and medicine. The study was conducted at a single institution. This survey serves as a foundation for other medical schools interested in developing a collaborative programming approach to address AI literacy in medical education."

b0353596b7efaff2e3298d2463c37a28026bd045,use and understanding of anonymization and deidentification in the biomedical literature scoping review,"Background The secondary use of health data is central to biomedical research in the era of data science and precision medicine. National and international initiatives, such as the Global Open Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (GO FAIR) initiative, are supporting this approach in different ways (eg, making the sharing of research data mandatory or improving the legal and ethical frameworks). Preserving patients’ privacy is crucial in this context. De-identification and anonymization are the two most common terms used to refer to the technical approaches that protect privacy and facilitate the secondary use of health data. However, it is difficult to find a consensus on the definitions of the concepts or on the reliability of the techniques used to apply them. A comprehensive review is needed to better understand the domain, its capabilities, its challenges, and the ratio of risk between the data subjects’ privacy on one side, and the benefit of scientific advances on the other. Objective This work aims at better understanding how the research community comprehends and defines the concepts of de-identification and anonymization. A rich overview should also provide insights into the use and reliability of the methods. Six aspects will be studied: (1) terminology and definitions, (2) backgrounds and places of work of the researchers, (3) reasons for anonymizing or de-identifying health data, (4) limitations of the techniques, (5) legal and ethical aspects, and (6) recommendations of the researchers. Methods Based on a scoping review protocol designed a priori, MEDLINE was searched for publications discussing de-identification or anonymization and published between 2007 and 2017. The search was restricted to MEDLINE to focus on the life sciences community. The screening process was performed by two reviewers independently. Results After searching 7972 records that matched at least one search term, 135 publications were screened and 60 full-text articles were included. (1) Terminology: Definitions of the terms de-identification and anonymization were provided in less than half of the articles (29/60, 48%). When both terms were used (41/60, 68%), their meanings divided the authors into two equal groups (19/60, 32%, each) with opposed views. The remaining articles (3/60, 5%) were equivocal. (2) Backgrounds and locations: Research groups were based predominantly in North America (31/60, 52%) and in the European Union (22/60, 37%). The authors came from 19 different domains; computer science (91/248, 36.7%), biomedical informatics (47/248, 19.0%), and medicine (38/248, 15.3%) were the most prevalent ones. (3) Purpose: The main reason declared for applying these techniques is to facilitate biomedical research. (4) Limitations: Progress is made on specific techniques but, overall, limitations remain numerous. (5) Legal and ethical aspects: Differences exist between nations in the definitions, approaches, and legal practices. (6) Recommendations: The combination of organizational, legal, ethical, and technical approaches is necessary to protect health data. Conclusions Interest is growing for privacy-enhancing techniques in the life sciences community. This interest crosses scientific boundaries, involving primarily computer science, biomedical informatics, and medicine. The variability observed in the use of the terms de-identification and anonymization emphasizes the need for clearer definitions as well as for better education and dissemination of information on the subject. The same observation applies to the methods. Several legislations, such as the American Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), regulate the domain. Using the definitions they provide could help address the variable use of these two concepts in the research community."

a9e8c2932597b426357de248832fa1dcf90a751c,infrastructure and tools for teaching computing throughout the statistical curriculum,"ABSTRACT Modern statistics is fundamentally a computational discipline, but too often this fact is not reflected in our statistics curricula. With the rise of big data and data science, it has become increasingly clear that students want, expect, and need explicit training in this area of the discipline. Additionally, recent curricular guidelines clearly state that working with data requires extensive computing skills and that statistics students should be fluent in accessing, manipulating, analyzing, and modeling with professional statistical analysis software. Much has been written in the statistics education literature about pedagogical tools and approaches to provide a practical computational foundation for students. This article discusses the computational infrastructure and toolkit choices to allow for these pedagogical innovations while minimizing frustration and improving adoption for both our students and instructors. Supplementary materials for this article are available online."
76de95d90ec8d812ff02b9290d4bbd7f6951854c,narratives and counternarratives on data sharing in africa,"As machine learning and data science applications grow ever more prevalent, there is an increased focus on data sharing and open data initiatives, particularly in the context of the African continent. Many argue that data sharing can support research and policy design to alleviate poverty, inequality, and derivative effects in Africa. Despite the fact that the datasets in question are often extracted from African communities, conversations around the challenges of accessing and sharing African data are too often driven by non-African stakeholders. These perspectives frequently employ a deficit narratives, often focusing on lack of education, training, and technological resources in the continent as the leading causes of friction in the data ecosystem. We argue that these narratives obfuscate and distort the full complexity of the African data sharing landscape. In particular, we use storytelling via fictional personas built from a series of interviews with African data experts to complicate dominant narratives and to provide counternarratives. Coupling these personas with research on data practices within the continent, we identify recurring barriers to data sharing as well as inequities in the distribution of data sharing benefits. In particular, we discuss issues arising from power imbalances resulting from the legacies of colonialism, ethno-centrism, and slavery, disinvestment in building trust, lack of acknowledgement of historical and present-day extractive practices, and Western-centric policies that are ill-suited to the African context. After outlining these problems, we discuss avenues for addressing them when sharing data generated in the continent."
7b56f852d91c3d6dd1c08196e6edf0f96ff18964,embedding data science into computer science education,"As a fast-growing field with widespread impact on economy and its promising hiring potential, Data Science has been enthusiastically sought-out by many disciplines in the academia, including Mathematics, Statistics, Library Science, Management Information Systems, as well as Computer Science, as an attracting area for recruiting students, soliciting grants, and expanding their existing programs. Although some standalone programs in Data Science have been established around the country, many institutions encounter the challenges in balancing the curricula among different disciplines, allocating new resources, and cooperating with the existing majors regarding enrollment management, student advising, and faculty preparation. In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways. It has become the consensus that an adequate exposure to Data Science will better prepare computer science students for taking the challenges in this ever-changing, data embraced world."

The conference subsequently is open to all and grows in size annually. The 2016 conference, held on June 2 to 3, 2016, included a total of 170 participants, with 79 first-time attendees. The intent of the Big Data Conference is unique. Although participants gain new knowledge about data science topics of importance to nursing, Dr Connie White-Delaney, Dean of the University of Minnesota, believes that this conference is distinguished by its commitment to partnering and continued work among the participants. This year’s conference included updates, offered by experts in the field of nursing and data science, on efforts to integrate nurse-sensitive data into the electronic/ virtual fabric of health systems in ways that produce comparability to support best practices for documentation and use of the data for quality improvement, research, and business analytics. Created in the style of a “think tank/summit,” the conference is complimented by the establishment of 11 virtual working groups, which continue collaborating throughout the year. Think tank/summit participants and working group members, in collaboration with respective national organizations and initiatives, have produced many achievements in practice, education, research, and health policy since the first conference in 2013. This year’s meeting was marked by “...a sense of celebration of what has been accomplished through partnership and working with established organizations, ...to advance shareable and comparable data access and use for nursing” (email communication, C. White-Delaney, June 2016). Three themes characterized these accomplishments: sharing a framework for data gathering and sharing of nursesensitive data, nursing education standards that reflect the nurse’s role in technology and electronic health records (EHRs), and big data science that includes nursing’s leadership and contribution to transforming health and healthcare."

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide the opportunity to train professionals in a sustainable and cost-effective way. We present a protocol for the design and development of a blended MOOC on real-world evidence (RWE) aimed at improving RWE data science skills. The primary objective is to provide the opportunity to understand the fundamentals of RWE data science and to implement methods for analysing RWD. The blended format of MOOC will combine the expertise of healthcare professionals joining the course online with the on-campus students. We expect learners to take skills taught in MOOC and use them to seek new employment or to explore entpreneurship activities in these domains. Methods and analysis The proposed MOOC will be developed through a blended format using the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation instructional design model and following the connectivist–heutagogical learning theories (as a hybrid MOOC). The target learners will include postgraduate students and professionals working in the health-related roles with interest in data science. An evaluation of MOOC will be performed to assess MOOCs success in meeting its intended outcomes and to improve future iterations of the course. Ethics and dissemination The education course design protocol was approved by EIT Health (grant 18654) as part of the EIT Health CAMPUS Deferred Call for Innovative Education 2018. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal."

After a survey of current academic and non-academic programs across the globe, we focus on Canadian programs and specifically on the education program of the SciNet HPC Consortium, using its detailed enrollment and course statistics for the past four to five years. Not only do these data display a steady and rapid increase in the demand for research-computing instruction, they also show a clear shift from traditional (high performance) computing to data-oriented methods. It is argued that this growing demand warrants specialized research computing degrees. The possible curricula of such degrees are described next, taking existing programs as an example, and adding SciNet's experiences of student desires as well as trends in advanced research computing."

It is essential they learn by working on assignments that involve real world data sets to develop the skills needed to be successful in the workplace. However, enabling instructors to flexibly deliver all kinds of data science assignments using real world data sets to large numbers of learners (both on-campus and off-campus) at low cost is a significant open challenge. To address this emerging challenge generally, we develop and deploy a novel Cloud-based Lab for Data Science (CLaDS) to enable many learners around the world to work on real-world data science problems without having to move or otherwise distribute prohibitively large data sets. Leveraging version control and continuous integration, CLaDS provides a general infrastructure to enable any instructor to conveniently deliver any hands-on data science assignment that uses large real world data sets to as many learners as our cloud-computing infrastructure allows at very low cost. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CLaDS and discuss our experience with using CLaDS to deploy seven major text data assignments for students in both an on-campus course and an online course to work on for learning about text data retrieval and mining techniques; this shows that CLaDS is a very promising novel general infrastructure for efficiently delivering a wide range of hands-on data science assignments to a large number of learners at very low cost."
5c4964faa7fbff1491c400b836eb2f0cd3bada80,python in data science research and education,"In this paper we demonstrate how Python can be used throughout the entire life cycle of a graduate program in Data Science. In interdisciplinary fields, such as Data Science, the students often come from a variety of different backgrounds where, for example, some students may have strong mathematical training but less experience in programming. Python’s ease of use, open source license, and access to a vast array of libraries make it particularly suited for such students. In particular, we will discuss how Python, IPython notebooks, scikitlearn, NumPy, SciPy, and pandas can be used in several phases of graduate Data Science education, starting from introductory classes (covering topics such as data gathering, data cleaning, statistics, regression, classification, machine learning, etc.) and culminating in degree capstone research projects using more advanced ideas such as convex optimization, non-linear dimension reduction, and compressed sensing. One particular item of note is the scikit-learn library, which provides numerous routines for machine learning. Having access to such a library allows interesting problems to be addressed early in the educational process and the experience gained with such “black box” routines provides a firm foundation for the students own software development, analysis, and research later in their academic experience."

At present, the granularity of the labor division between data science and big data is more refined. Traditional work methods, from work infrastructure environment construction to data modelling and analysis of working methods, will greatly delay work and research efficiency. In this paper, we focus on the purpose of the current friendly collaboration of the data science team to build data science and big data analysis application platform based on microservices architecture for education or nonprofessional research field. In the environment based on microservices that facilitates updating the components of each component, the platform has a personal code experiment environment that integrates JupyterHub based on Spark and HDFS for multiuser use and a visualized modelling tools which follow the modular design of data science engineering based on Greenplum in-database analysis.

c1037cb996aa2d64d6e995687a674625c58a733b,knowledge discovery for higher education student retention based on data mining machine learning algorithms and case study in chile,"Data mining is employed to extract useful information and to detect patterns from often large data sets, closely related to knowledge discovery in databases and data science. In this investigation, we formulate models based on machine learning algorithms to extract relevant information predicting student retention at various levels, using higher education data and specifying the relevant variables involved in the modeling. Then, we utilize this information to help the process of knowledge discovery. We predict student retention at each of three levels during their first, second, and third years of study, obtaining models with an accuracy that exceeds 80% in all scenarios. These models allow us to adequately predict the level when dropout occurs. Among the machine learning algorithms used in this work are: decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, naive Bayes, random forest, and support vector machines, of which the random forest technique performs the best. We detect that secondary educational score and the community poverty index are important predictive variables, which have not been previously reported in educational studies of this type. The dropout assessment at various levels reported here is valid for higher education institutions around the world with similar conditions to the Chilean case, where dropout rates affect the efficiency of such institutions. Having the ability to predict dropout based on student’s data enables these institutions to take preventative measures, avoiding the dropouts. In the case study, balancing the majority and minority classes improves the performance of the algorithms."
39299f3138e36fb0a0c9cdd71fd47311992cb4b6,towards implementation of omop in a german university hospital consortium,"Background  In 2015, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research initiated a large data integration and data sharing research initiative to improve the reuse of data from patient care and translational research. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model and the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tools could be used as a core element in this initiative for harmonizing the terminologies used as well as facilitating the federation of research analyses across institutions. Objective  To realize an OMOP/OHDSI-based pilot implementation within a consortium of eight German university hospitals, evaluate the applicability to support data harmonization and sharing among them, and identify potential enhancement requirements. Methods  The vocabularies and terminological mapping required for importing the fact data were prepared, and the process for importing the data from the source files was designed. For eight German university hospitals, a virtual machine preconfigured with the OMOP database and the OHDSI tools as well as the jobs to import the data and conduct the analysis was provided. Last, a federated/distributed query to test the approach was executed. Results  While the mapping of ICD-10 German Modification succeeded with a rate of 98.8% of all terms for diagnoses, the procedures could not be mapped and hence an extension to the OMOP standard terminologies had to be made. Overall, the data of 3 million inpatients with approximately 26 million conditions, 21 million procedures, and 23 million observations have been imported. A federated query to identify a cohort of colorectal cancer patients was successfully executed and yielded 16,701 patient cases visualized in a Sunburst plot. Conclusion  OMOP/OHDSI is a viable open source solution for data integration in a German research consortium. Once the terminology problems can be solved, researchers can build on an active community for further development."

Largely centered on performance measurement, data-driven accountability tools are used to engineer work processes according to best practices and transfer policy to practice through tying quantitative outcomes to consequential valuation schemes. In this early work, we present preliminary insights from a multi-sited ethnography of ongoing development of infrastructure for data science being developed for purposes of organizational accountability in the healthcare. The aim is to describe key concerns in the design of ‘infrastructure for accountability’ (consisting of the array IT, organizations, organizational relationships, standards, and roles being developed to undergird performance measurement). Some initial considerations for design of infrastructure for accountability include dual functions of the data, communication hierarchy, emergent seams, and bridging installed bases and communities of practice. This research has implications for researchers, designers, and managers of infrastructure for accountability, as well contributing ethnographic empirical insights into social and organizational implications of creating the data-driven world."

For the continuity of educational processes, a transition from a traditional educational model (face-to-face) to emergency remote teaching (ERT) was made through virtual learning platforms and learning management system (LMS) schemes. Universidad del Valle de Mexico (UVM), in a collaboration agreement with Microsoft Co., chose to use Teams to continue its educational process. In this work, we intend to identify the factors that can be taken into account regarding the level of student satisfaction in the teaching–learning process in ERT using Teams, and validate the established educational strategy. Statistical analysis was carried out to analyze the academic environment for these scenario changes while considering knowledge assessment, and competencies achievement. A combined sampling method was applied with convenience and statistical analysis. The main results established significant percentages, where more than 60% of the students surveyed were manifested in the use of the teams and the organization of the class sessions by the teachers, and the activities developed. Using the Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient, the reliability of the data collection instruments was determined. The correlations of each of the survey questions were calculated to determine the relationship between themselves and the total answers, giving results similar to those obtained through data science tools. Taking advantage of the situation, data science tools were applied to compare the results with obtained values from RapidMiner software in the correlation of factors in of 0.440, 0.384, 0.246, 0.048 and 0.384."

It is forecast that 75% of enterprise applications will use AI, Machine Learning or Deep Learning technology by 2021, yet university programs commonly place the burden on students to obtain their data science educations through elective coursework spanning multiple disparate departments. Data science requires specific mathematics preparation especially for cybersecurity students whose programs have reduced the requirements for advance mathematics to a bare minimum. To facilitate curricula preparation, and hands-on usage of AI tools, a notebook (“A Trellis For Novice AI Practitioners”) was prepared in the R programming language as a first step in introducing computer science and cybersecurity students to the concepts and capabilities of AI. A focus on an intrusion detection data set to mitigate nine common cyber vulnerabilities is used in this analysis. Trellis bridges the theoretical and practical chasm for students by building an ANN network intrusion predictive model from scratch. It serves as a template but also encourages heavy contextual modification, and may be relied upon in the beginning stages of a cybersecurity practitioner's data science activities on a wide variety of data sets in all areas of the discipline."

Methods Twitter data (N=82,893) related to both older adults and COVID-19 and dated from January 23 to May 20, 2020, were analyzed. We used a combination of data science methods (including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, supervised machine learning, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis), qualitative thematic analysis, and conventional statistics. Results The most common category in the coded tweets was “personal opinions” (66.2%), followed by “informative” (24.7%), “jokes/ridicule” (4.8%), and “personal experiences” (4.3%). The daily average of ageist content was 18%, with the highest of 52.8% on March 11, 2020. Specifically, more than one in ten (11.5%) tweets implied that the life of older adults is less valuable or downplayed the pandemic because it mostly harms older adults. A small proportion (4.6%) explicitly supported the idea of just isolating older adults. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) within “jokes/ridicule” targeted older adults, half of which were “death jokes.” Also, 14 themes were extracted, such as perceptions of lockdown and risk. A bivariate Granger causality test suggested that informative tweets regarding at-risk populations increased the prevalence of tweets that downplayed the pandemic. Discussion Ageist content in the context of COVID-19 was prevalent on Twitter. Information about COVID-19 on Twitter influenced public perceptions of risk and acceptable ways of controlling the pandemic.

While the number of data science programs continues to increase, few discussions have examined how we should define this emerging educational field. With this in mind, during the 23rd Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS’17), a panel discussion explored emerging questions regarding data science and analytics education. This paper reports on that panel discussion, which focused on questions such as what a data science degree is and what a data science program’s learning objectives are. The panel also debated if there should be different types of data science-related programs (such as an applied data science program or a business analytics program) and, if so, should there be a common core across the different variations of programs. Information system educators who can gain a better understanding of current trends in data science/analytics education and other information system researchers who are interested in how data science/analytics might impact the broader field of information systems and management education should find interest in this report."

However, currently, data science educators lack good tools and methodologies. In particular, they lack integrated tools through which their students can acquire hands-on software engineering experience. To address these problems, we designed and implemented DataLab, a web-based tool for data science education that integrates code, data and execution management into one system. The goal of DataLab is to provide a hands-on online lab environment to train students to have basic software engineering thinking and habits while maintaining a focus on the core data science contents. In this paper, we present the user-experience design and system-level implementation of DataLab. Further, we evaluate DataLab's performance through an in-classroom use case. Finally, using objective log-based learning behavior analysis and a subjective survey, we demonstrate DataLab's effectiveness."

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to lay out the data competence maturity model (DCMM) and discuss how the application of the model can serve as a foundation for a measured and deliberate use of data in secondary education.


Design/methodology/approach
Although the model is new, its implications, and its application are derived from key findings and best practices from the software development, data analytics and secondary education performance literature. These principles can guide educators to better manage student and operational outcomes. This work builds and applies the DCMM model to secondary education.


Findings
The conceptual model reveals significant opportunities to improve data-driven decision making in schools and local education agencies (LEAs). Moving past the first and second stages of the data competency maturity model should allow educators to better incorporate data into the regular decision-making process.


Practical implications
Moving up the DCMM to better integrate data into their decision-making process has the potential to produce profound improvements for schools and LEAs. Data science is about making better decisions. Understanding the path laid out in the DCMM to helping an organization move to a more mature data-driven decision-making process will help improve both student and operational outcomes.


Originality/value
This paper brings a new concept, the DCMM, to the educational literature and discusses how these principles can be applied to improve decision making by integrating them into their decision-making process and trying to help the organization mature within this framework.

(Or, at least, a domain that is becoming distinctly defined.) He calls on writings by John Tukey, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman, among others, to remind us that statisticians have been dealing with data science for years, and encourages acceptance of the direction of the field while also ensuring that statistics is tightly integrated. 
As faculty at baccalaureate institutions (where the growth of undergraduate statistics programs has been dramatic), we are keen to ensure statistics has a place in data science and data science education. In his paper, Donoho is primarily focused on graduate education. At our undergraduate institutions, we are considering many of the same questions."

Researchers have been used the computational intelligence (CI) and machine learning techniques methodologies to develop a smart tutoring systems (STSs). On the other side, the convergence of AI, data science and Internet of Things (IoT) is enabling the creation of a new generation of web-based smart systems for all educational and learning tasks. This paper discusses the CI and knowledge engineering paradigms for developing the smart educational and learning systems. In this study the two popular CI paradigms; case-based reasoning and ontological engineering are discussed and analyzed namely. The main objective of this study is to determine and exploration the benefits and advantages of such intelligent paradigms to increase the effectiveness and enhancing the efficiency of the smart tutoring systems. Moreover, the paper addresses the challenges faced by the application developers and knowledge engineers in developing and deploying such systems."

Colab was designed for AI and data science researchers to share reproducible experiments and explanations of techniques, but we have also found it well suited to classroom use. The primary benefit is that it provides students computational resources sufficient to run modern AI techniques interactively, and avoids students needing to separately configure software packages and dependencies, since they can run notebooks shared by the instructor. We briefly outline two of our notebooks, for teaching deep learning with Tensorflow, and reinforcement learning with OpenAI Gym."

Creating a classification model to accurately identify factors affecting student performance can be challenging. Much research has been conducted to predict student performance in higher education, but there is limited research in using data science to predict student performance in K-12 education. Predictive models are developed and examined in this review to analyze a K-12 education dataset. Three classifiers are used to develop these predictive models, including linear regression, decision tree, and Naive Bayes techniques. The Naive Bayes techniques showed the highest accuracy when predicting SAT Math scores for high school students. The results from this review of current research and the models presented in this paper can be used by stakeholders of K-12 education to make predictions of student performance and be able to implement intervention strategies for students in a timely manner."
06ec3bd8addd503e7f000a6ada7541b344b2e3fd,advocating the broad use of the decision tree method in education,"Predictive studies have been widely undertaken in the field of education to provide strategic information about the extensive set of processes related to teaching and learning, as well as about what variables predict certain educational outcomes, such as academic achievement or dropout. As in any other area, there is a set of standard techniques that is usually used in predictive studies in the field education. Even though the Decision Tree Method is a well-known and standard approach in Data Mining and Machine Learning, and is broadly used in data science since the 1980's, this method is not part of the mainstream techniques used in predictive studies in the field of education. In this paper, we support a broad use of the Decision Tree Method in education. Instead of presenting formal algorithms or mathematical axioms to present the Decision Tree Method, we strictly present the method in practical terms, focusing on the rationale of the method, on how to interpret its results, and also, on the reasons why it should be broadly applied. We first show the modus operandi of the Decision Tree Method through a didactic example; afterwards, we apply the method in a classification task, in order to analyze specific educational data."
ab1a4f9a0271f184db25eb304ea8b0d6dc1cc5b9,an experiencecentered approach to training effective data scientists,"Like medicine, psychology, or education, data science is fundamentally an applied discipline, with most students who receive advanced degrees in the field going on to work on practical problems. Unlike these disciplines, however, data science education remains heavily focused on theory and methods, and practical coursework typically revolves around cleaned or simplified data sets that have little analog in professional applications. We believe that the environment in which new data scientists are trained should more accurately reflect that in which they will eventually practice, and we propose here a data science master’s degree program that takes inspiration from the residency model used in medicine. Students in the suggested program would spend their time working on a practical problem with an industry, government, or nonprofit partner, supplemented with coursework in data science methods and theory. We also discuss how this program can also be implemented in shorter formats to augment existing professional master’s programs in different disciplines. This approach to learning by doing is designed to fill gaps in our current approach to data science education and ensure that students develop the skills they need to practice data science in a professional context and under the many constraints imposed by"

Yet, there are challenges to those learning and applying these methods. In this chapter, we provide an overview of a nascent area of both scholarship and teaching, educational data science. We define educational data science as the combination of capabilities related to quantitative methods in educational research, computer science and programming capabilities, and teaching, learning, and educational systems. We demonstrate that there are two distinct—but complementary—perspectives on educational data science in terms of being both in education (as a research methodology) and for education (as a teaching and learning content). We describe both of these areas in light of foundational and recent research. Lastly, we highlight three future directions for educational data science, emphasizing the synergies between these two perspectives concerning designing tools that can be used by both learners and professionals, foregrounding representation, inclusivity, and access as first-order concerns for those involved in the growing community, and using data science methodologies to study teaching and learning about data science. We highlight the potential for the growth of educational data science within learning design and technology as situated with the broader data science domain and in education more broadly."

Education is one of the fields that is expanding its use of data science to improve the quality of education. The United States denotes primary and secondary school as grades kindergarten (K) through 12th grade. This is representative of education prior to college/university level. Data science in K-12 education is evaluated and important to the field of education because educators, administrators, and stakeholders are always looking for ways to close the achievement gap and increase performance of all students. Student performance evaluation using data science is crucial to closing this gap. Data mining is used in the evaluation and analysis of student performance, educational programs and educational instruction. It is also used to create prediction models for future student success. A K-12 education dataset will be used to evaluate student performance. This paper will explore and display student performance based on a variety of factors and data. Data science in K-12 education and its impact on student performance and educator use of this data is discussed. We have also performed review of existing work in the data analytics for K-12 education along with their limitations."

The conceptual framework of the One Digital Health Steering Wheel is built around two keys (ie, One Health and digital health), three perspectives (ie, individual health and well-being, population and society, and ecosystem), and five dimensions (ie, citizens’ engagement, education, environment, human and veterinary health care, and Healthcare Industry 4.0). One Digital Health aims to digitally transform future health ecosystems, by implementing a systemic health and life sciences approach that takes into account broad digital technology perspectives on human health, animal health, and the management of the surrounding environment. This approach allows for the examination of how future generations of health informaticians can address the intrinsic complexity of novel health and care scenarios in digitally transformed health ecosystems. In the emerging hybrid landscape, citizens and their health data have been called to play a central role in the management of individual-level and population-level perspective data. The main challenges of One Digital Health include facilitating and improving interactions between One Health and digital health communities, to allow for efficient interactions and the delivery of near–real-time, data-driven contributions in systems medicine and systems ecology. However, digital health literacy; the capacity to understand and engage in health prevention activities; self-management; and collaboration in the prevention, control, and alleviation of potential problems are necessary in systemic, ecosystem-driven public health and data science research. Therefore, people in a healthy One Digital Health ecosystem must use an active and forceful approach to prevent and manage health crises and disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic."

Under the background of big data era, data science, learning analysis and education have made great achievements. In the field of education under big data, all kinds of new paradigms are constantly emerging and have achieved very good results in actual education. In the era of education big data, how to fully tap the value of big data for online education practice, decision-making, evaluation and research, and how to avoid the risk of big data are important issues in the current education reform and development. This paper analyzes the application of the current scientific paradigm in education, constructs the construction paradigm of online education evaluation model, and puts forward a new education concept in order to promote the development of the new paradigm of big data online education technology research. Applying this paradigm, a series of educational evaluation models are constructed from the macro, miso and micro levels, which play a positive role in the research, decision-making, practice and evaluation of related fields."
93d96f23133dd07807723fcbc05414ab5c1689f9,integrating data science into a general education information technology course an approach to developing data savvy undergraduates,"The National Academies recommend academic institutions foster a basic understanding of data science in all undergraduates. However, data science education is not currently a graduation requirement at most colleges and universities. As a result, many graduates lack even basic knowledge of data science. To address the shortfall, academic institutions should incorporate introductory data science into general education courses. A general education IT course provides a unique opportunity to integrate data science education. Modules covering databases, spreadsheets, and presentation software, already present in many survey IT courses, teach concepts and skills needed for data science. As a result, a survey IT course can provide comprehensive introductory data science education by adding a data science module focused on modeling and evaluation, two key steps in the data science process. The module should use data science software for application, avoiding the complexities of programming and advanced math, while enabling an emphasis on conceptual understanding. We implemented a course built around these ideas and found that the course helps develop data savvy in students."
d141840c3c5adf3a3b9a65ab9c55afe39a163c3a,toward catchment hydrobiogeochemical theories,"Headwater catchments are the fundamental units that connect the land to the ocean. Hydrological flow and biogeochemical processes are intricately coupled, yet their respective sciences have progressed without much integration. Reaction kinetic theories that prescribe rate dependence on environmental variables (e.g., temperature and water content) have advanced substantially, mostly in well‐mixed reactors, columns, and warming experiments without considering the characteristics of hydrological flow at the catchment scale. These theories have shown significant divergence from observations in natural systems. On the other hand, hydrological theories, including transit time theory, have progressed substantially yet have not been incorporated into understanding reactions at the catchment scale. Here we advocate for the development of integrated hydro‐biogeochemical theories across gradients of climate, vegetation, and geology conditions. The lack of such theories presents barriers for understanding mechanisms and forecasting the future of the Critical Zone under human‐ and climate‐induced perturbations. Although integration has started and co‐located measurements are well under way, tremendous challenges remain. In particular, even in this era of “big data,” we are still limited by data and will need to (1) intensify measurements beyond river channels and characterize the vertical connectivity and broadly the shallow and deep subsurface; (2) expand to older water dating beyond the time scales reflected in stable water isotopes; (3) combine the use of reactive solutes, nonreactive tracers, and isotopes; and (4) augment measurements in environments that are undergoing rapid changes. To develop integrated theories, it is essential to (1) engage models at all stages to develop model‐informed data collection strategies and to maximize data usage; (2) adopt a “simple but not simplistic,” or fit‐for‐purpose approach to include essential processes in process‐based models; (3) blend the use of process‐based and data‐driven models in the framework of “theory‐guided data science.” Within the framework of hypothesis testing, model‐data fusion can advance integrated theories that mechanistically link catchments' internal structures and external drivers to their functioning. It can not only advance the field of hydro‐biogeochemistry, but also enable hind‐ and fore‐casting and serve the society at large. Broadly, future education will need to cultivate thinkers at the intersections of traditional disciplines with hollistic approaches for understanding interacting processes in complex earth systems."

Data Science education programs are rapidly being created on all levels. Usually it happens through reuse or renaming and can result in curricula that lack proper balance of competences, which balance is necessary for future data scientists. Our quantitative analysis of over 300 programs worldwide shows that at least one of the three core data science competence groups is under-represented in the majority of programs. Moreover, general business courses are often suggested to students to cover the domain competence group, which in most cases results in superficial treatment of this competence group. Our further qualitative analysis demonstrates that learning outcomes for most of the courses are usually not defined or defined improperly."

However, harnessing such large-scale data, using modern technologies for effective decision-making appears to be an evolving science that requires knowledge of Big Data management and analytics. Big data in agriculture, manufacturing, and education are varied such as voluminous text, images, and graphs. Applying Big data science techniques (e.g., functional algorithms) for extracting intelligence data affords decision markers quick response to productivity, market resilience, and student enrollment challenges in today’s unpredictable markets. This chapter serves to employ data science for potential solutions to Big Data applications in the sectors of agriculture, manufacturing and education to a lesser extent, using modern technological tools such as Hadoop, Hive, Sqoop, and MongoDB."
89805a46d99bc7f39a2fd0d3f8148805ef67f5e1,on the horizon implications for nursing education,"Each year, the New Media Consortium and the Educause Learning Initiative work together to generate the Horizon Report, a projection of technology trends, challenges, and emerging technologies. A distinguished panel of experts, from 17 countries and 6 continents, was involved in the generation of the 2015 report. Once the panel identified topics for each section, a modified Delphi process was used, with an extensive literature review. (To examine the iterations that occurred throughout the process, see the wiki at http://horizon.wiki.nmc.org.) Each section of the final report focuses on how trends, challenges, and emerging technologies will inform and impact practice, leadership, and policy. TRENDS The 2015 report (Johnson, Adams Becker, Estrada, & Freeman, 2015) provides six key trends that are projected to accelerate the adoption of technologies within higher education. In three time periods, they are: * Short-term (1-2 years): increased use of blended learning and the redesign of learning spaces. * Mid-term (3-4 years): growing focus on measurement of learning and proliferation of open educational resources. * Long-term: advancing cultures of change and innovation and greater cross-institutional collaboration. Short-Term The increased use of blended learning is driven by the shift in student and educator perceptions of the value of online learning. The National Center for Education Statistics Distance Education (US Department of Education, 2014) noted that, according to 2012 data, 1 in 10 students were enrolled exclusively in online courses. In contrast, 2013 data revealed that 1 in 8 students took all their courses online (Poulin & Straut, 2015). Allen and Seaman (2015) reported that 7.1 million students in the United States are engaged in online learning. A growing body of research supports the efficacy and effectiveness of online learning and the benefits of blending learning. The redesign of learning spaces to accommodate the growing use of technologies is not a new concept. In 2006, I wrote an article on ""think spots"" that highlighted the need to break out of the mold of traditional classrooms (Skiba, 2006). Now, with the emergence of mobile and smart technologies as well as an emphasis on active and collaborative learning strategies, there is renewed interest in creating new learning spaces for the transformation of higher education. Two resources that may be helpful to find best practices in active learning design are FLEXspace (https://flexspaceannouncements.wordpress. com) and Learning Space Collaboratory (www.pkallsc.org). Mid-Term Data science, learning analytics, and big data are all driving forces behind the measurement of learning. As in business and health care, the harvesting of data to predict, market, and manage are standard operating procedures. The goals, according the report (Johnson et al., 2015, p. 12), are ""to build better pedagogies, empower students to take an active part in their learning, target at-risk student populations, and assess factors affecting completion and student success."" The report states that for learners, educators, and researchers, ""learning analytics [are] already starting to provide crucial insights into student progress and interaction with online texts, courseware, and learning environments used to deliver instruction."" We now see examples of how students use dashboards to improve their learning. Administrators also use them, to direct strategic planning, and educators use them, to manage advisees and analyze the impact of their teaching on learning. It was noted that the measurement of learning has the greatest impact on policy. Long-Term The idea that innovations in education can scale better when shared across institutions is the basis for the long-term trend of cross-institutional collaboration. Universities are aligning with others to share resources for teaching, research, and technology infrastructure. …"

As a result of the field's fluidity, there is often a mismatch between what data-related programs teach, what employers expect, and the actual tasks data scientists are performing. In addition, the tools available to data scientists are not necessarily the tools being taught; textbooks do not seem to meet curricular needs; and empirical evidence does not seem to support existing program design. Currently, the field appears to be bifurcating into data science (DS) and data engineering (DE), with specific but overlapping roles in the combined data science and engineering (DSE) lifecycle. However, curriculum design has not yet caught up to this evolution.

In particular, I show how the bias-variance tradeoff from machine learning can be formally generalized to be applicable to several prominent educational debates, including debates around learning theories (cognitivist vs. situativist and constructivist theories) and pedagogy (direct instruction vs. discovery learning). I then look to see how various data science techniques that have been proposed to navigate the bias-variance tradeoff can yield insights for productively navigating these educational debates going forward."

And while progress has been made in developing more inclusive classroom pedagogies and programs, rates of representation have remained low over the past 20 years. The emerging field of data science with its roots in both computer science and statistics faces the same challenges, but also presents a unique opportunity to build a more inclusive framework for the teaching of STEM. The widening application of data science methods to nearly every field imaginable in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities opens up avenues for engagement based on what students care about and the challenges they are most interested in tackling. Data science therefore provides an opportunity to build an inclusive STEM curriculum from the ground up that connects with multiple disciplines as well as the personal passions of students.Keywords: education, inclusive teaching, pedagogy, STEM, curriculum, statistics, computer science"

The participants were second-year undergraduate students majoring in Economics, Sociology, Management and Humanities, enrolled in the Data Science minor. Using expectancy-value theory as a framework, we aim (1) to analyze gender differences in motivation; (2) to identify the link between the components of motivation and academic achievement; (3) to estimate the role of the previous academic achievement and educational choices. Two alternativetheoretical models are proposed and tested on empirical data. Structural equation modeling (SEM) in M Plus 7.31 was used for analysis. We found that the course is more popular among males students, who also demonstrate higher level of expectancy for success. However, there is no gender difference in academic performance. Students majoring in Sociology and Economics perceive Data Science as more interesting and useful than Management and Humanities students. SEM analysis empirically validated the model in which expectancy of success directly influences academic achievement, and values influence is mediated by expectancies. The final model that includes motivation, gender, student""s major, and previous achievement explains 34% of variance in academic performance. We discuss the role of different components of student motivation and practical significance of our results."

Blazars are drawing growing interest following the consolidation of their position as the most abundant type of source in the extragalactic very high-energyγ-ray sky, and because of their status as prime candidate sources in the nascent field of multi-messenger astrophysics. As such, blazar astrophysics is becoming increasingly data driven, depending on the integration and combined analysis of large quantities of data from the entire span of observational astrophysics techniques. The project was therefore chosen as one of the pilot activities within the United Nations Open Universe Initiative, whose objective is to stimulate a large increase in the accessibility and ease of utilisation of space science data for the worldwide benefit of scientific research, education, capacity building, and citizen science.Methods.Our aim is to deliver innovative data science tools for multi-messenger astrophysics. In this work we report on a data analysis pipeline calledSwift-DeepSky based on theSwiftXRTDAS software and the XIMAGE package, encapsulated into a Docker container.Swift-DeepSky downloads and reads low-level data, generates higher level products, detects X-ray sources, and estimates several intensity and spectral parameters for each detection, thus facilitating the generation of complete and up-to-date science-ready catalogues from an entire space-mission data set.Results.As a first application of our innovative approach, we present the results of a detailed X-ray image analysis based onSwift-DeepSky that was run on allSwift-XRT observations including a known blazar, carried out during the first 14 years of operations of theNeil Gehrels SwiftObservatory. Short exposures executed within one week of each other have been added to increase sensitivity, which ranges between ∼1 × 10−12and ∼1 × 10−14erg cm−2s−1(0.3–10.0 keV). After cleaning for problematic fields, the resulting database includes over 27 000 images integrated in different X-ray bands, and a catalogue, called 1OUSXB, that provides intensity and spectral information for 33 396 X-ray sources, 8896 of which are single or multiple detections of 2308 distinct blazars. All the results can be accessed online in a variety of ways, from the Open Universe portal through Virtual Observatory services, via the VOU-Blazar tool and the SSDC SED builder. One of the most innovative aspects of this work is that the results can be easily reproduced and extended by anyone using the Docker version of theSwift-DeepSky pipeline, which runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows machines, and does not require any specific experience in X-ray data analysis."
0fa8430872a3132fc942e3c6aae6f875444f6319,establishing abet accreditation criteria for data science,"Prompted by the skyrocketing demand for data scientists, progress made by the ACM Data Science Task Force on defining data science competencies, and inquiries about data science accreditation, ABET is in the process of developing accreditation criteria for undergraduate data science programs. The effort is led by members of a joint data science criteria subcommittee appointed by ABET's Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) and CSAB (the lead society for computing accreditation). Establishing data science accreditation criteria is a notable milestone in the maturing data science discipline, indicating the presence of an accepted body of knowledge, standards of practice, and ethical codes for practitioners. This position paper motivates the effort and discusses prior work towards defining data science education requirements. It describes the ongoing process for creating and obtaining approval of the accreditation criteria, and how feedback was and will be solicited from the computing and statistical communities. The current draft data science criteria, which was approved in July 2020 by the relevant ABET bodies for a year of public review and comment, is presented. These criteria emphasize the three pillars of data science: computing foundations, mathematical/statistical foundations, and experience in at least one data application domain. This report thus serves both to inform and to stimulate the academic discussion needed to finalize appropriate data science accreditation by ABET."

The education of these specialists should combine elements from three fields: Industrial engineering, data analysis and data administration. However, a comprehensive education program incorporating all three elements has not yet been established in Germany. The aim of the acquired research project, titled “Industrial Data Science” is to develop and implement a qualification concept for Machine Learning based on demands coming up in industrial environments. The concept is targeted at two groups: Advanced students from any of the three mentioned fields (Mechanical Engineering, Statistics, Computer Science) and industrial professionals.

Data Science as a research and academic discipline provides a basis for Data Analytics and ML/AI applications. The education and training of the data related professions must reflect all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science and handling practitioners in modern, data-driven research and the digital economy. In the modern era, with ever faster technology changes, matched by strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training programme should be customizable and deliverable in multiple forms, tailored for different categories of professional roles and profiles. Referring to other publications by the authors on building customizable and interoperable Data Science curricula for different types of learners and target application domains, this paper is focused on defining a set of transversal competences and skills that are required from modern and future Data Science professions. These include workplace and professional skills that cover critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity required to work in highly automated and dynamic environment. The proposed approach is based on the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) initially developed within the EU funded Project EDISON and currently being further developed in the EU funded MATES project and also the FAIRsFAIR projects."

(1) Â Â Â Â  In contrast to traditional methods of teaching that leave little trail behind, online learning has the potential to generate huge amounts of data about the students and their way of learning in terms of records, logs, interactions and digital footprint. (2) Â Â Â Â  The availability of huge datasets, increased computer power and the pressure towards better teaching and learning, personalization of the content and improving educational system has led to increased interest in learning analytics research. (3, 4, 5) Â Â Â Â  Learning analytics (LA) is an emerging and rapidly developing research discipline in the field of technology enhanced learning that -by definition- aims at â€œmeasurement, collection, analysis and reporting of these data and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occursâ€ . (2, 5) Â Â Â Â  Using analytics in the field of higher education can improve the decision making process based on actual data and real trends that are derived from studentsâ€™ behavior and resource usage. LA can foster institutional growth, increase productivity, create innovative models and enable institutions to understand strengths and challenge. (5, 6) It can be used to predict studentsâ€™ performance, personalize instruction, build adaptive systems and alarms of potential underachievement in real time.

2419bec5ec51b1958edda18d5629925da12feae3,collaboratory at columbia an aspen grove of data science education,"Many universities recognize the rapidly growing impact of data science in all fields of study and the professions and seek to embed this expertise widely across their educational offerings. There is often broad interest in developing new data science curricula, with some universities even allocating funds toward this purpose. Yet, it is often unclear what resources are needed for effective data science education, and how resources ought to be prioritized. Although university leadership might be aware of a growing number of successful data science acceleration programs and pedagogical models, many of which are either general purpose or specific to a particular discipline, there remains a lack of clarity about how these models might address their own specific needs. This article presents the Collaboratory Program at Columbia University (termed “the Collaboratory”), which is both a set of “data science in context” educational approaches, as well as a meta-model for an accelerator program that allows different institutions to respond flexibly to their own disciplinary heterogeneity in terms of data science educational needs. The novelty of the Collaboratory lies in its crowd-sourcing approach to creating new data science pedagogy and its ability to kindle transdisciplinary collaboration in doing so. By offering seed funding, it fosters proactive efforts to embed data science “in context” into more traditional domains through a cohort of compelling, transdisciplinary, crowd-sourced data science education proposals each year. Collaboratory educational offerings are required to be developed through a partnership between two faculty members, a data scientist and a domain expert from another field, or a larger team with complementary expertise. Over the past 5 years, the Collaboratory has supported the development of a wide spectrum of data science pedagogical models spread across more than 40 academic departments, centers, institutes, and professional schools at Columbia University. As a result, the Collaboratory has to date served the learning needs of more than 4,000 students. Furthermore, it has cultivated a thriving ecosystem that includes a funding mechanism and a community-support structure that all contribute to its agility and success. Here, we offer our experience and best practices in developing and managing the Collaboratory, which, we hope, will contribute to a blueprint for data science education leaders everywhere."

There are numerous anecdotes involving abuses of complex data analyses and algorithms, and the impact they have had on society. In this paper, we discuss what statisticians can do to help enhance data science ethics in practice and what statistics educators can do to instil sound ethical behaviour in our students. We have opportunities to practice and teach ethical conduct relevant to all stages of the data life cycle. This paper discusses issues impacting ethical data science, with a focus on how statisticians can help raise awareness and encourage implementation of ethical best practices."

In this paper, we examine the sociotechnical practices of data wrangling—strategies for selecting and managing datasets to produce a model and story in a big data interface—for youth assembling models and stories about family migration using interactive data visualization tools. Through interaction analysis of video data, we identified ten data wrangling practices and developed a conceptual model of the data wrangling process that contains four interrelated recursive stages. These data wrangling practices and the process of data wrangling are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positioned the youth as having agency and authority over big data."

It should be openly accessible to everyone, with as few barriers as possible; even more so for key technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS). Open Educational Resources (OER) are a crucial factor for greater educational equity. In this paper, we describe the specific requirements for OER in ML and DS and argue that it is especially important for these fields to make source files publicly available, leading to Open Source Educational Resources (OSER). We present our view on the collaborative development of OSER, the challenges this poses, and first steps towards their solutions. We outline how OSER can be used for blended learning scenarios and share our experiences in university education. Finally, we discuss additional challenges such as credit assignment or granting certificates."

Many organizations and business intelligence experts have foreseen the significant development in the big data field as next big wave in future research arena in many industry sectors and the society. To become an expert and skilled in this newly emerging field, we propose an effective and inexpensive learning model called ‘Ekalavya model’ of distance education heard in Mahabharata story of Indian Epics. In this paper, we have discussed the importance of Big data based data analytics. The advantages, benefits, constraints, and disadvantages of big data based analytics are discussed. In order to increase skilled data technicians called data engineers and scientists, we have discussed how Ekalavya model of knowledge and skill development can be used by utilizing various existing online skill development facilities with no financial investment and expenditure. The proposed Ekalavya model can be realized through opportunities and facilities provided by an innovative model of IBM’s Big data University. The paper contains the initiatives of IBM’s Big Data University to develop data scientists, data engineers, and business data professionals using online independent study by aspirants at their convenient time ubiquitously using Ekalavya model of Indian education system.

STS scholars are uniquely trained to investigate the societal context of science and technology as well as the meaning STEM researchers attach to their day-to-day work practices. In this project, we use a collaborative, co-constitutive method of doing ethics education that focuses on building an ethical framework based on empirical practices, highlighting two issues in particular: data validity and the relations between data and inequalities. Through data-grounded scenario writing, we demonstrate how STS scholars and other social scientists can apply their expertise to the production of educational materials to spark broad ranging discussions that explore the connections between values, ethics, STEM, politics, and social contexts."

Our research pushes the bounds of current system deployment by proposing and testing an ICT-based participatory data management system to transform participants from data providers to data consumers. This tool begins with participatory design, which engages participants in deciding which types of data to collect. Then, it involves training them in data collection, analysis and management. This enables participants to gain basic data science skills to make informed decisions. Our study uses mixed methods to explore the feasibility and effects of this system with urban refugees living in Rwanda. The quantitative results indicate refugees' perceived effectiveness in using the system to build communities is directly influenced by system usability assessments, which in turn are influenced by education levels but not ICT self-efficacy. Qualitative results highlight the community-based interactions experienced by all participants and highlight important differences in pursuing projects with urban versus camp-based refugees."

Analyzing masses of versatile data leads to insights that, in turn, may connect to successful business strategies, crime prevention, or better health care just to name a few. Big Data is primarily approached as mathematical and technical challenge. This may lead to technology design that enables useful insights from Big Data. However, this technology-driven approach does not meet completely and consistently enough the variety of information consumer requirements. To catch up with the versatility of user needs, the technology aspect should probably be secondary. If we adopt a user-driven approach, we are more in the position to cope with the individual expectations and exigencies of information consumers. This article takes information discovery as the overarching paradigm in data science and explains how this perspective change may impact the view on the profession of the data scientist and, resulting from that, the curriculum for the education in data science. It reflects the result from discussions with companies participating in our student project cooperation program. These results are groundwork for the development of a curriculum framework for Applied Data Science."

5b2ca1b0af6ecfdc6df09408f4c2a9ab2333f5ff,introducing teachers who use guidriven tools for the randomization test to codedriven tools,"ABSTRACT The advent of data science has led to statistics education researchers re-thinking and expanding their ideas about tools for teaching statistical modeling, such as the use of code-driven tools at the secondary school level. Methods for statistical inference, such as the randomization test, are typically taught within secondary school classrooms using GUI-driven tools. A teaching experiment was conducted, using a learning task designed to introduce teachers familiar with using GUI-driven tools for teaching the randomization test to code-driven tools. Our findings from this exploratory study indicate that the design principles and considerations used to create the learning task supported teachers’ introduction to code-driven tools and encouraged an integration of statistical and computational thinking."
2d49f81fb690f8c2e7af5849c3d6ba5eef931740,what to consider when we consider data,"The data sets used in statistics education have changed over time, from mathematically “well‐behaved” ones that facilitated computation, to more context‐rich sources and now, with the increasing influence of data science practices, to “found” data, often from open data sites. As data sources change, it is important for educators to take a fresh look at the ways we engage students in thinking about the processes that generated the data they encounter. The use of already collected data requires particular attention because many of the decisions that went into the processes of obtaining the data are hidden. Students need to learn to ask “Who, When, How, Where, and Why?” data were collected and to wonder if the data really measure what needs to be measured. Our advocacy in this paper is to deepen the educational treatment of data production to better reflect the current and future practice of statistics and data science."

As it has become axiomatic that more data are produced every year, commentators have been driven to call this revolution the “age of big data.” However, what is commonly known as “big data” is not a new concept: the use of data to build successful products and services, optimize business processes, and make more efficient data-based decisions already has an established history. Moreover, the term big data is ambiguous: the main features of big data (quantity, speed, variety) are technical properties that depend not on the data themselves but on the evolution of computing, storage, and processing technologies. What is important about big data is not its volume but how it may contribute to innovation and therefore be used to create value. This is why this chapter uses data-driven innovation to frame the discussion.High-value solutions that may not have quantifiable economic value are being developed using data, and many sectors, from businesses to governments, benefit from data-driven innovation. Apart from producing and using data for better policymaking processes, the public sector can also play its part in promoting and fostering data-driven innovation and growth throughout economies by (1) making public data accessible through open data formats, (2) promoting balanced legislation, and (3) supporting education that focuses on data science skills."
57b5695efa50d12c5a1ac5156a6752d10823f181,integrating computing in the statistics and data science curriculum creative structures novel skills and habits and ways to teach computational thinking,"ABSTRACT Nolan and Temple Lang argued for the fundamental role of computing in the statistics curriculum. In the intervening decade, the statistics education community has acknowledged that computational skills are as important to statistics and data science practice as mathematics. There remains a notable gap, however, between our intentions and our actions. In this special issue of the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, we have assembled a collection of articles that (1) suggest creative structures to integrate computing, (2) describe novel data science skills and habits, and (3) propose ways to teach computational thinking. We believe that it is critical for the community to redouble our efforts to embrace sophisticated computing in the statistics and data science curriculum. We hope that these articles provide useful guidance for the community to move these efforts forward."
f91289000d48fe2e9778e5eb7f0f55edc7459326,a clinical approach to training effective data scientists,"Like medicine, psychology, or education, data science is fundamentally an applied discipline, with most students who receive advanced degrees in the field going on to work on practical problems. Unlike these disciplines, however, data science education remains heavily focused on theory and methods, and practical coursework typically revolves around cleaned or simplified data sets that have little analog in professional applications. We believe that the environment in which new data scientists are trained should more accurately reflect that in which they will eventually practice, and we propose here a data science master's degree program that takes inspiration from the residency model used in medicine. Students in the suggested program would spend their time working on a practical problem with an industry, government, or nonprofit partner, supplemented with coursework in data science methods and theory. We also discuss how this program can also be implemented in shorter formats to augment existing professional master's programs in different disciplines. This approach to learning by doing is designed to fill gaps in our current approach to data science education and ensure that students develop the skills they need to practice data science in a professional context and under the many constraints imposed by that context."

The study was conducted by the International Medical Informatics Association Nursing Informatics Special Interest Group (IMIA-NISIG) Student Working Group. Based on findings from this cross-sectional study, we identified future NI research priorities. We used snowball sampling technique to reach respondents from academia and practice. Data were collected between August and September 2015. Altogether, 373 responses from 44 countries were analyzed. The identified top ten NI trends were big data science, standardized terminologies (clinical evaluation/implementation), education and competencies, clinical decision support, mobile health, usability, patient safety, data exchange and interoperability, patient engagement, and clinical quality measures. Acknowledging these research priorities can enhance successful future development of NI to better support clinicians and promote health internationally."

These data are from a wide array of contexts including education, foreign policy, criminal justice, housing, and health care. Accordingly, undergraduate instructors of statistics and data science have an invaluable opportunity to engage students in social justice through the lens of quantitative analytics. In this paper I elaborate on ways I have incorporated these topics and data across a wide range of undergraduate statistics and data science courses. I also describe ways I seek to foster student reflection on the realities of social inequity, not just as data analysts but as world citizens. I conclude by discussing challenges I have faced and opportunities for future growth."

8ea0a111c9c7a00c0e656f4e9fdb93b624f7727a,the new data of student debt,"Where you go to college and what you choose to study has always been important, but, with the help of data science, it may now determine whether you get a student loan. Silicon Valley is increasingly setting its sights on student lending. Financial technology (“fintech”) firms such as SoFi, CommonBond, and Upstart are ever-expanding their online lending activities to help students finance or refinance educational expenses. These online companies are using a wide array of alternative, education-based data points—ranging from applicants’ chosen majors, assessment scores, the college or university they attend, job history, and cohort default rates—to determine creditworthiness. Fintech firms argue that through their low overhead and innovative approaches to lending they are able to widen access to credit for underserved Americans. Indeed, there is much to recommend regarding the use of different kinds of information about young consumers in order assess their financial ability. Student borrowers are notoriously disadvantaged by the extant scoring system that heavily favors having a past credit history. Yet there are also downsides to the use of education-based, alternative data by private lenders. This Article critiques the use of this education-based information, arguing that while it can have a positive effect in promoting social mobility, it could also have significant downsides. Chief among these are reifying existing credit barriers along lines of wealth and class and further contributing to discriminatory lending practices that harm women, black and Latino Americans, and other minority groups. The discrimination issue is particularly salient because of the novel and opaque underwriting algorithms that facilitate these online loans. This Article concludes by proposing three-pillared regulatory guidance for private student lenders to use in designing, implementing, and monitoring their education-based data lending programs."

Our analysis of the technological, funding, and organizational structure of four types of institutions shows an increasing divergence in the ability of universities across the United States to provide students with accessible data science education infrastructure, primarily JupyterHub. We observe that generally liberal arts colleges, community colleges, and other institutions with limited IT staff and experience have greater difficulty setting up and maintaining JupyterHub, compared to well-funded private institutions or large public research universities with a deep technical bench of IT staff. However, by leveraging existing public-private partnerships and the experience of Canada’s national JupyterHub (Syzygy), the U.S. has an opportunity to provide a wider range of institutions and students access to JupyterHub."
91529c389f9002981953bffea46dab8cafe89391,a call for mixed methods in competencybased medical education how we can prevent the overfitting of curriculum and assessment,"Competency-based medical education (CBME) has been the subject of heated debate since its inception in medical education. Despite the many challenges and pitfalls of CBME that have been recognized by the medical education community, CBME is now seeing widespread implementation. However, the biggest problems with CBME still have not been solved. Two of these problems, reductionism and loss of authenticity, present major challenges when developing curricula and assessment tools.The authors address these problems by making a call for flexibility in competency definitions and for the use of mixed methods in CBME. First, they present the issue of reductionism and a similar concept from the field of data science, overfitting. Then they outline several solutions, both conceptual and concrete, to prevent undue reductionist tendencies in both competency definitions and in tools of assessment. Finally, they propose the reintroduction of qualitative methods to balance the historically quantitative emphasis of assessment in medical education.The authors maintain that mixed-methods assessment with multiple assessors in differing contexts can yield a more accurate representation of a medical trainee's skills and abilities, deter the loss of authenticity, and increase the willingness of medical educators to adopt a feasible form of CBME. Finally, they propose the deployment of dedicated faculty assessors and physician coaches (which will reduce training requirements for other faculty), as well as the use of formal qualitative tools of assessment alongside established quantitative tools, to encourage a truly mixed-methods approach to assessment."
85fe8c0051e46884d15ef8eb35e1b201dbbaa898,data science meets standardized game learning analytics,"Data science applications in education are quickly proliferating, partially due to the use of LMSs and MOOCs. However, the application of data science techniques in the validation and deployment of serious games is still scarce. Among other reasons, obtaining and communicating useful information from the varied interaction data captured from serious games requires specific data analysis and visualization techniques that are out of reach of most non-experts. To mitigate this lack of application of data science techniques in the field of serious games, we present T-Mon, a monitor of traces for the xAPI-SG standard. T-Mon offers a default set of analysis and visualizations for serious game interaction data that follows this standard, with no other configuration required. The information reported by T-Mon provides an overview of the game interaction data collected, bringing analysis and visualizations closer to non-experts and simplifying the application of serious games."

Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module. The report window demonstrates the expected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a specific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed transaction information is also provided for back-testing purpose. Students are involved into the development of the software and get experience for R-programming. Preliminary version of the product has been tested and surveyed in a data science classroom. About ten junior Data Science students have practiced and provided feedback. The positive survey results show the feasibility of the approach. In the future, artificial intelligent component will be integrated into the platform."

An integral part of many degree programs is a capstone experience, where students complete a major research or real-world project at the culmination of their educational program. In engineering and computer science, many have shown that client-sponsored projects lead to better student engagement and improved training. In this paper, we discuss experiences with developing an interdisciplinary, client-sponsored capstone program in data science and machine learning. We show how we set up the capstone program, including how the program is structured, how projects are set up, how the course is managed, how students are assessed, and outline the newly developed capstone curriculum. Finally, we report results from a cohort of students participating in this capstone program and discuss lessons learned as well as best practices when developing data science capstone programs."

With machine learning becoming an essential technology in computational biology, we must include training about overfitting in all courses that introduce this technology to students and practitioners. We here propose a hands-on training for overfitting that is suitable for introductory level courses and can be carried out on its own or embedded within any data science course. We use workflow-based design of machine learning pipelines, experimentation-based teaching, and hands-on approach that focuses on concepts rather than underlying mathematics. We here detail the data analysis workflows we use in training and motivate them from the viewpoint of teaching goals. Our proposed approach relies on Orange, an open-source data science toolbox that combines data visualization and machine learning, and that is tailored for education in machine learning and explorative data analysis."

Educating aspiring minds to meet highest standards in these facets is the mandate of institutions of higher education. This, naturally, includes the preparation for excelling in today’s data-driven world. In recent years, an intensive academic discussion has resulted in the distinction between two different modes of data related education: data science and data literacy education. As a large number of study programs and offers is emerging around the world, data literacy in higher education is a particular focus of this paper. These programs, despite sharing the same name, differ substantially in their educational content, i.e., a high plurality can be observed. This paper explores this plurality, comments on the role it might play and suggests ways it can be dealt with by maintaining a high degree of adaptiveness and plurality while simultaneously establishing a consistent educational “essence”. It identifies a skill set, data self-empowerment, as a potential part of this essence. Data science and literacy education are still experiencing changeability in their emergence as fields of study, while additionally being stirred up by rapid developments, bringing about a need for flexibility and dialectic."

It offers a diverse range of scalable and redundant service deployment models, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS). These models are applied to areas such as IoT, Cyber-Physical Systems, Social Media, Data Science, Media Streaming, Ecommerce, and Health Informatics. The growth in cloud presents challenges for companies to source cloud expertise to support their business, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises with limited resources. The UK Government recently published the Digital Skills Crisis report, identifying skill-set challenges facing industry, with a shortage in cloud skills negatively impacting business. While cloud technologies have evolved at significant pace, the development of Computer Science curriculum in the further and higher education sector has lagged behind. The challenges faced in the sector includes the training of educators, institutional gaps (software and hardware policies), regulatory constraints, and access to cloud platforms. By embedding fundamental cloud skills throughout the educator and student journey, both stakeholders will be better positioned to understand and practically apply the use of appropriate cloud services, and produce graduates to support the needs of industry. This working group has carried out work to: i) assess current cloud computing curricula in CS and similar programs, ii) document industry needs for in-demand cloud skills, iii) identify issues and gaps around cloud curriculum uptake, and iv) develop solutions to meet the skill demands on core Cloud Computing topics, technical skills exercises, and modules for integration with contemporary Computer Science curricula."

These activities seek to shape public and clinician beliefs about laboratory testing, the benefits and harms of prescription drugs, and some disease definitions. Objective To review the marketing of prescription drugs, disease awareness campaigns, health services, and laboratory tests and the related consequences and regulation in the United States over a 20-year period (1997-2016). Evidence Analysis (1997-2016) of consumer advertising (Kantar Media data for spending and number of ads); professional marketing (IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, Open Payments Data [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services]); regulations and legal actions of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and US Department of Justice; and searches (1975-2018) of peer-reviewed medical literature (PubMed), business journals (Business Source Ultimate), and news media (Lexis Nexis) for articles about expenditures, content, and consequences and regulation of consumer and professional medical marketing. Spending is reported in 2016 dollars. Findings From 1997 through 2016, spending on medical marketing of drugs, disease awareness campaigns, health services, and laboratory testing increased from $17.7 to $29.9 billion. The most rapid increase was in direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising, which increased from $2.1 billion (11.9%) of total spending in 1997 to $9.6 billion (32.0%) of total spending in 2016. DTC prescription drug advertising increased from $1.3 billion (79 000 ads) to $6 billion (4.6 million ads [including 663 000 TV commercials]), with a shift toward advertising high-cost biologics and cancer immunotherapies. Pharmaceutical companies increased DTC marketing about diseases treated by their drugs with increases in disease awareness campaigns from 44 to 401 and in spending from $177 million to $430 million. DTC advertising for health services increased from $542 million to $2.9 billion, with the largest spending increases by hospitals, dental centers, cancer centers, mental health and addiction clinics, and medical services (eg, home health). DTC spending on advertising for laboratory tests (such as genetic testing) increased from $75.4 million to $82.6 million, although the number of ads increased more substantially (from 14 100 to 255 300), reflecting an increase in less expensive electronic media advertising. Marketing to health care professionals by pharmaceutical companies accounted for most promotional spending and increased from $15.6 billion to $20.3 billion, including $5.6 billion for prescriber detailing, $13.5 billion for free samples, $979 million for direct physician payments (eg, speaking fees, meals) related to specific drugs, and $59 million for disease education. Manufacturers of FDA-approved laboratory tests paid $12.9 million to professionals in 2016. From 1997 through 2016, the number of consumer and professional drug promotional materials that companies submitted for FDA review increased from 34 182 to 97 252, while FDA violation letters for misleading drug marketing decreased from 156 to 11. Since 1997, 103 financial settlements between drug companies and federal and state governments resulted in more than $11 billion in fines for off-label or deceptive marketing practices. The FTC has acted against misleading marketing by a single for-profit cancer center. Conclusions and Relevance Medical marketing increased substantially from 1997 through 2016, especially DTC advertising for prescription drugs and health services. Pharmaceutical marketing to health professionals accounted for most spending and remains high even with new policies to limit industry influence. Despite the increase in marketing over 20 years, regulatory oversight remains limited."

c8710ad1e591a816123e96acd809a8fd59416239,biomedical informatics meets data science current state and future directions for interaction,"Abstract There are an ever-increasing number of reports and commentaries that describe the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of big data and data science (DS) in the context of biomedical education, research, and practice. These publications argue that there are substantial benefits resulting from the use of data-centric approaches to solve complex biomedical problems, including an acceleration in the rate of scientific discovery, improved clinical decision making, and the ability to promote healthy behaviors at a population level. In addition, there is an aligned and emerging body of literature that describes the ethical, legal, and social issues that must be addressed to responsibly use big data in such contexts. At the same time, there has been growing recognition that the challenges and opportunities being attributed to the expansion in DS often parallel those experienced by the biomedical informatics community. Indeed, many informaticians would consider some of these issues relevant to the core theories and methods incumbent to the field of biomedical informatics science and practice. In response to this topic area, during the 2016 American College of Medical Informatics Winter Symposium, a series of presentations and focus group discussions intended to define the current state and identify future directions for interaction and collaboration between people who identify themselves as working on big data, DS, and biomedical informatics were conducted. We provide a perspective concerning these discussions and the outcomes of that meeting, and also present a set of recommendations that we have generated in response to a thematic analysis of those same outcomes. Ultimately, this report is intended to: (1) summarize the key issues currently being discussed by the biomedical informatics community as it seeks to better understand how to constructively interact with the emerging biomedical big data and DS fields; and (2) propose a framework and agenda that can serve to advance this type of constructive interaction, with mutual benefit accruing to both fields."

The Case Method approach is necessary for Data Science education to expose students to real scenarios that challenge them to develop the appropriate skills to deal with practical problems by providing solutions for different activities. Data science combines multiple fields like statistics, scientific methods, and data analysis to extract value from data, being an umbrella term used for multiple industries, such as data analytics, data mining, machine learning, big data, business intelligence, and predictive analytics. This paper gives an overview of success factors for using the Case Method in teaching Applied Data Science education. Showing that close analysis provides a deeper understanding of implications, connects theory to practice, and classes unfold without a detailed script when successful instructors simultaneously manage content and process. This synthesis of current research can be used by Applied Data Science educators to more effectively plan the use of the Case Method as one possible teaching method."

Python has become the language of choice for teaching data science at both graduate and undergraduate programs. From data preprocessing, pattern extraction, predictive modeling, to visualization, the language has important libraries and tools to achieve this seamlessly. In this paper, the pedagogical approaches and learning objectives achieved by a cohort of graduate students specific to using Python at all stages of the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) life cycle are highlighted. The need to do this is motivated by describing an undergraduate data mining course taught at a STEM program in Computer Science. Teaching and research experiences to build projects are also elaborated across these groups. The paper then proposes recommended practices for teaching Python at the graduate level in similar data science programs.1Python Software Foundation, [Online]. Available: https://www.python.org/"
caa3226dbc8677336bc5d98dd371df038a91a40c,innovation in undergraduate data science education,"The workshop will allow participants to gain experience with a series of innovations developed at UC Berkeley that have enabled the teaching of undergraduate data science at scale to students from all backgrounds. Rather than beginning with established introductory strategies as the gateway to computer science, students in the ""Foundations of Data Science"" (data8.org) learn computational skills and concepts in relation to real world issues and with attention to societal implications. By engaging with students' interest in the applications of computing on data, and integrating societal impact from the start, the program has developed long term commitment to advance computational skills for large numbers of students. These innovations in teaching not only convey important computational content, but also broaden participation beyond existing approaches to computer science, and integrate issues of human contexts and ethics throughout the full curriculum. Goals include increasing diversity among students learning computer science, giving students a strong ethical foundation within their computer science work, and encouraging critical thinking in the application of inference and statistical techniques.

eaa0a133ad9f5a96d652e7d0f44c14eecb0609ff,review of cybersecurity research topics taxonomy and challenges interdisciplinary perspective,"As cybersecurity is a growing field of science, there is not complete agreement across the scope of cybersecurity research topics. This paper proposes a grouping and classifications of cybersecurity researches to introduce an easily referenceable taxonomy of the cybersecurity research topics. A literature survey was conducted to collect published literature review papers about various cybersecurity researches during the past five years periods. Taxonomic analysis of 99 selected papers, which were grouped based on research topic similarities, produced sets of research categories. It categorized the cybersecurity research topics into 8 areas: (1) Applied cybersecurity, (2) Cybersecurity data science, (3) Cybersecurity education and training, (4) Cybersecurity incidents, (5) Cybersecurity management and policy, (6) Cybersecurity technology, (7) Human and social cybersecurity and (8) Theories in cybersecurity. Although cybersecurity grew out of the computer science field, this paper argues that its interdisciplinary nature (not only technical computer security, but also data, system/technology, and human/social) can attract researcher from various disciplines, such as management, policy, psychology, and so on, to contribute to cybersecurity advancement."
1a448e145bd05834e98bdb4acc785b432cffb1a8,the importance of being causal,"Causal inference is the study of how actions, interventions, or treatments affect outcomes of interest. The methods that have received the lion’s share of attention in the data science literature for establishing causation are variations of randomized experiments. Unfortunately, randomized experiments are not always feasible for a variety of reasons, such as an inability to fully control the treatment assignment, high cost, and potential negative impacts. In such settings, statisticians and econometricians have developed methods for extracting causal estimates from observational (i.e., nonexperimental) data. Data scientists’ adoption of observational study methods for causal inference, however, has been rather slow and concentrated on a few specific applications. In this article, we attempt to catalyze interest in this area by providing case studies of how data scientists used observational studies to deliver valuable insights at LinkedIn. These case studies employ a variety of methods, and we highlight some themes and practical considerations. Drawing on our learnings, we then explain how firms can develop an organizational culture that embraces causal inference by investing in three key components: education, automation, and certification."

3533d091c4a8af5a20f58d189e808c8b6e311724,remembering what produced the data individual and social reconstruction in the context of a quantified self elementary data and statistics unit,"Abstract Given growing interest in K-12 data and data science education, new approaches are needed to help students develop robust understandings of and familiarity with data. The model of the quantified self—in which data about one’s own activities are collected and made into objects of study—provides inspiration for one such approach. By drawing on what one already knows about their self and their prior experiences, it may be possible to bootstrap students’ abilities to interpret and make sense of data. Taking that possibility seriously, this article describes some of the gains observed in students’ statistical reasoning following a quantified self, wearables-based elementary statistics unit and provides a theoretical framework drawing from cognitive psychology, embodiment, and situative perspectives to characterize how prior experience is used as a resource in data sense-making when the data are about students’ own physical experiences. This framework centralizes and interrogates the work of “remembering” prior experiences and articulates how remembering is involved in interpreting quantified self data. Specifically, the framework emphasizes that remembering in service of data interpretation is a reconstructive act that draws from both general and specific embodied resources and that the work of reconstructive remembering in the classroom is both individual and multi-participant work. To demonstrate measured learning gains and illustrate the framework, written assessment results and descriptive cases of student and teacher discussions about quantified self data from two sixth-grade classes participating in a classroom design experiment are provided. Both a discussion of and recommendations for ethical considerations related to quantified self data in education are also provided."

Initially, SciNet offered isolated training events on how to use HPC systems and write parallel code, but the training program now consists of a broad range of workshops and courses that users can take toward certificates in scientific computing, data science, or high-performance computing. Using data on enrollment, attendence, and certificate numbers from SciNet's education website, used by almost 1800 users so far, we extract trends on the growth, demand, and breadth of SciNet's training program. Among the results are a steady overall growth, a sharp and steady increase in the demand for data science training, and a wider participation of 'non-traditional' computing disciplines, which has motivated an increasingly broad spectrum of training offerings. Of interest is also that many of the training initiatives have evolved into courses that can be taken as part of the graduate curriculum at the University of Toronto."

Do the lessons we learned and now teach regarding automation based on previous generations of technology still apply? What level of DS and ML expertise is needed for a human factors engineer to have a relevant role in the design of future automation? How do we integrate these topics into a field that often has not emphasized quantitative skills? This panel discussion brings together human factors engineers and educators at different stages of their careers to consider how curricula are being adapted to include data science and machine learning, and what the future of human factors education may look like in the coming years."

The current public health crisis has highlighted the need for students and educators to have a deeper understanding of epidemiology. While existing STEM curricula has addressed these topics in the past, current events present an opportunity for new curricula that can be designed to present epidemiology, the science of public health, as a modern topic for students that embeds the problem-solving and mathematics skills of computational thinking practices authentically. Using the Computational Thinking Taxonomy within the informal education setting of a STEM outreach program, a curriculum was developed to introduce middle school students to epidemiological concepts while developing their problem-solving skills, a subset of their computational thinking and mathematical thinking practices, in a contextually rich environment. The informal education setting at a Research I Institution provides avenues to connect diverse learners to visually engaging computational thinking and data science curricula to understand emerging teaching and learning approaches. This paper documents the theory and design approach used by researchers and practitioners to create a Pandemic Awareness STEM Curriculum and future implications for teaching and learning computational thinking practices through engaging with data science."
ac440b5020654e0510b1ac28c63e8ffb866a3059,an integrated modular approach to data science education in microbiology,"We live in an increasingly data-driven world, where high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms are transforming biology into an information science. This has shifted major challenges in biological research from data generation and processing to interpretation and knowledge translation. However, postsecondary training in bioinformatics, or more generally data science for life scientists, lags behind current demand. In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has the potential to improve research and learning outcomes as well as better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated cocurricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants (TAs), postdocs, instructors, and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems. Preliminary survey results indicate that even a single module improves student self-reported interest and/or experience in bioinformatics and computer science. Thus, EDUCE provides a flexible and extensible active learning framework for integration of data science curriculum into undergraduate courses and programs across the life sciences."

According to the findings of this study, Data Scientists require programming, mathematics, and database abilities, all of which may be learned by self-study or through formal education. Companies looking to hire a Data Science team must be aware of the wide range of tasks that Data Scientists may fill, as well as the need for soft skills such as storytelling and connection building in addition to technical abilities and knowledge. The interpretation emphasizes that high school students interested in pursuing a career in Data Science should learn programming, mathematics, databases, and, most importantly, exercise their newfound knowledge. The study's findings centered on data scientists as analytical specialists who employ their expertise in both technology and social science to discover patterns and manage data. The solutions to business difficulties are discovered via the use of industry expertise, contextual awareness, and skepticism of current assumptions."
be40fcb6bc86bdebd8ee216267d5c9aa780fb2be,learning how to teach science with big data,"As science educators, it is our responsibility to help prepare our students for the future. To do this, education is constantly adapting. The content and the skills students need for their future careers and lives and the knowledge and skills educators need to prepare their students change in response to the continuing developments in both science and our knowledge of the learning process. The future is uncertain, but there are areas of science that we can predict will rapidly develop. Big Data is one such field. The National Science Board, Vision 2030 report has predicted revolutions including that of “Big Data”. Vision and Change explains the importance of big data since “scientists need to interact with information in new ways”. Big Data which can be defined as “Data that is so large, fast or complex that it's difficult or impossible to process using traditional methods” and is therefore an area that should be included in the science curriculum. As educators, we may recognise the importance of students using big data and realizing its possibilities but not know how to approach teaching it or using big data sets in our own research. To address this, the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) and the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) have organised the 2021, International virtual meeting—“Teaching Science with Big Data” to be held on 20–25 June. The IUBMB and ASBMB both have education as core elements of their missions and strong backgrounds in organising and supporting education and are pleased to be working together on this exciting meeting, designed for educators to learn valuable teaching skills and prepare students for the future. This international meeting will focus on best practices for teaching with and about big data science. It will guide educators on how to teach using web-based, free-access large data sets. The meeting is designed for faculty who would like to get started teaching science with open-source big data applications and participants are not expected to have expertise in computer programming or the software involved. The meeting will commence with the Keynote presentation “NIH perspectives on Big Data” by Michael Lauer, NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Initiative. Michael Lauer, M.D., is the deputy director for extramural research at the National Institutes of Health, USA. Major sessions of the meeting are interactive workshops designed to lead participants through exercises that analyse big data sets. In addition, faculty will share strategies for teaching students to visualize results from analysis of large datasets. The workshop topics include:"
95eaee3e0293fc019acb937e91f987f06dc1dbfb,transitioning educations knowledge infrastructure shaping design or shouting from the touchline,"Bit by bit, a data-intensive substrate for education is being designed, plumbed in and switched on, powered by digital data from an expanding sensor array, data science and artificial intelligence. The configurations of educational institutions, technologies, scientific practices, ethics policies and companies can be usefully framed as the emergence of a new “knowledge infrastructure” (Paul Edwards). The idea that we may be transitioning into significantly new ways of knowing – about learning and learners – is both exciting and daunting, because new knowledge infrastructures redefine roles and redistribute power, raising many important questions. For instance, assuming that we want to shape this infrastructure, how do we engage with the teams designing the platforms our schools and universities may be using next year? Who owns the data and algorithms, and in what senses can an analytics/AI-powered learning system be ‘accountable’? How do we empower all stakeholders to engage in the design process? Since digital infrastructure fades quickly into the background, how can researchers, educators and learners engage with it mindfully? If we want to work in “Pasteur’s Quadrant” (Donald Stokes), we must go beyond learning analytics that answer research questions, to deliver valued services to frontline educational users: but how are universities accelerating the analytics innovation to infrastructure transition? Wrestling with these questions, the learning analytics community has evolved since its first international conference in 2011, at the intersection of learning and data science, and an explicit concern with those human factors, at many scales, that make or break the design and adoption of new educational tools. We are forging open source platforms, links with commercial providers, and collaborations with the diverse disciplines that feed into educational data science. In the context of ICLS, our dialogue with the learning sciences must continue to deepen to ensure that together we influence this knowledge infrastructure to advance the interests of all stakeholders, including learners, educators, researchers and leaders. Speaking from the perspective of leading an institutional analytics innovation centre, I hope that our experiences designing code, competencies and culture for learning analytics sheds helpful light on these questions.

32a7b47bcd1ec5bd4be2875492e4ff99ab055a7d,toward computational apprenticeship bringing a constructivist agenda to computational pedagogy,"There is growing recognition of the need for computational pedagogy in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines that emphasizes discipline-based computational modeling and simulation problem-solving processes (Dym, 2004; Froyd, Wankat, & Smith, 2012; Magana, Falk, & Reese, 2013). Yet current research in this area remains largely definitional and aspirational in nature (College Board, 2013; Grover & Pea, 2013; National Research Council, 2011). To date, there are limited empirical studies on how best to support the development of computational skills in undergraduates (Kalelio glu, Gülbahar, & Kukul, 2016). As a result, outside of computer science, many postsecondary students' exposure to computing education remains siloed in introductory programming courses that lack integration with disciplinary content (Magana et al., 2013;Magana & Silva Coutinho, 2017). Furthermore, current practice in early or evenmid-degree undergraduate computational education in engineering majors tends to focus heavily on the procedural and technical aspects of programming knowledge and on the learning of specific programming languages rather than on the application of computation in problem solving and design (Buitrago Flórez et al., 2017; Pears et al., 2007; Vihavainen, Airaksinen, &Watson, 2014). These traditional instructional approaches adequately develop students' ability for near transfer—that is, the ability to apply known computational techniques in common disciplinary contexts (Butler & Morgan, 2007). However, even professional scientists and engineers struggle with far transfer, meaning the application of computational and data science approaches to novel or unfamiliar disciplinary challenges (Heroux & Allen, 2016; Madamanchi, Cardella, Glazier, & Umulis, 2018). Because the field of discipline-based computation is undertheorized, traditional instructional approaches have typically defaulted to teaching the cognitive aspects of computation. To build transferable skills and expertise, however, instructors can draw upon constructivist traditions by situating computation within disciplinary contexts. Researchers have previously investigated students' transfer of computational knowledge in engineering design courses through the concept of “computational adaptive expertise” (McKenna, Linsenmeier, & Glucksberg, 2008, p. 1). The growing relevance of computation in science and engineering disciplines suggests that computational adaptive expertise can be applied even more broadly as a construct to guide computational pedagogy in a variety of disciplines. We propose computational apprenticeship—an application of cognitive apprenticeship to disciplinebased computing education—as a constructivist research and practice model for developing computational adaptive expertise."

Hence, many two-year and four-year colleges and universities started to offer Data Science degrees in the recent decade. In this paper, we describe an undergraduate Data Science curriculum that focuses on computational skills and mathematical foundations, with inclusion of a domain in business analytics. We expect this paper to be used by institutions as a guideline while planning their Data Science undergraduate degree. We reviewed around 100 undergraduate Data Science programs in the U.S. and summarized their common approaches and we also reviewed several Data Science curriculum development guidelines. Then, we developed our interdisciplinary undergraduate Data Science program that consists of (1) mathematics and statistics foundation courses covering discrete mathematics, linear algebra, introductory statistics, analysis of variance, and regression, (2) computer science foundation courses covering two programming languages (namely Python and Java), data structures, and database management, (3) core data science courses covering data science and visualization, statistical machine learning, data mining, and machine learning, and finally (4) courses from the business domain covering business intelligence analytics and predictive analytics. At the end of the degree program, we include a choice among a senior capstone course, a statistical consulting course, or an internship. We also discuss the collaboration between departments and colleges for this program."

fd662717f300c2b7729f35c935d4fff6905f1bbe,equalizing data science curriculum for computer science pupils,"Data science is a new interdisciplinary field of research that focuses on extracting value from data. As an interdisciplinary science it integrates knowledge and methods from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and the domain knowledge of the data. As data science is still forming as a domain, several points of view exist on how to teach data science. The curriculum of many undergraduate data science programs includes advanced knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and one or more data domains. Several initiatives for designing high school data science curricula have emerged recently. Since it is unrealistic to teach all the above-mentioned advanced topics at the high school level, the high school data science curriculum focuses on a broad understanding of the data science workflow rather than on mathematical and algorithmic details that characterize undergraduate programs. High school computer science pupils, however, are expected to have a deep understanding of algorithms, as algorithms are the heart of computer science. In this paper, we present our attempt to adapt a data science course to computer science high school pupils that incorporates both a broad view on data science and data workflow, as well as deep understanding of data processing algorithms and specifically, machine learning. This course is taught for 10th grade computer science pupils in an Israeli public school, and was also taught in a summer workshop for computer science teachers."
864a1791f5a0210abdc5f82152c4e6bc9b8ced63,web scraping in the statistics and data science curriculum challenges and opportunities,"Abstract Best practices in statistics and data science courses include the use of real and relevant data as well as teaching the entire data science cycle starting with importing data. A rich source of real and current data is the web, where data are often presented and stored in a structure that needs some wrangling and transforming before they can be ready for analysis. The web is a resource students naturally turn to for finding data for data analysis projects, but without formal instruction on how to get that data into a structured format, they often resort to copy-pasting or manual entry into a spreadsheet, which are both time consuming and error-prone. Teaching web scraping provides an opportunity to bring such data into the curriculum in an effective and efficient way. In this article, we explain how web scraping works and how it can be implemented in a pedagogically sound and technically executable way at various levels of statistics and data science curricula. We provide classroom activities where we connect this modern computing technique with traditional statistical topics.

These data science programs represent a combination of subject areas from several disciplines. There are few studies have examined data science programs within a particular discipline, such as Business (e.g. Chen et al.). However, there are very few empirical studies that investigate DS programs and explore its curriculum structure across disciplines. Therefore, this study examines data science programs offered by American universities. The study aims to depict the current state of data science education in the U.S. to explore what discipline DS programs covers at the graduate level. The current study conducted an exploratory content analysis of 30 DS programs in the United States from a variety of disciplines. The analysis was conducted on course titles and course descriptions level. The study results indicate that DS programs required varying numbers of credit hours, including practicum and capstone. Management schools seem to take the lead and the initiative in lunching and hosting DS programs. In addition, all DS programs requires the basic knowledge of database design, representation, extraction and management. Furthermore, DS programs delivered information skills through their core courses. Moreover, the study results show that almost 40 percent of required courses in DS programs is involved information representations, retrieval and programming. Additionally, DS programs required courses also addressed communication visualization and mathematics skills."

Gradually, advances in Bayesian methodology and software have made Bayesian techniques much more accessible to applied statisticians and, in turn, have transformed Bayesian education at the undergraduate and graduate levels. In this article, we introduce the history behind Bayesian computing, discuss the important role of simulation, and lay out the foundation of Markov chain Monte Carlo. We further survey and weigh various options for implementing Bayesian computational methods in practice. We conclude with computing recommendations for different models of the modern Bayesian classroom, from introductory applied courses to advanced courses with more emphasis on theory."
23c720b9d27b1bfa568a80e0ce459391dfeac614,perspectives for an interdisciplinary data science curriculum in german secondary schools,"INTRODUCTION Data science and its associated buzzwords, for example big data, are more and more seen as relevant for education, but so far, few attempts have been made to introduce the field at the school level. Data science is not yet part of the curriculum in secondary schools in Germany and most other countries. In this introductory chapter, we discuss the goals of the symposium to inform future curriculum development, and we analyze experiences and curricular traditions from the two main subjects, computer science education and statistics education, on which we can build and that we relate to each other. Moreover, we will discuss principles of curriculum development on which we will base our approach. We also present a first look into our current idea of a future data science curriculum for secondary schools. As a step towards helping teachers and schools implement aspects of data science, we plan a collaboration with selected schools and teachers to implement and try out some ideas of data science in actual secondary classrooms. We subsequently plan to implement a year-long course of 3 hours per week for students who volunteer to take the course, which will in turn become an elective duty course for them that counts for the final examination. We will test ideas from data science with students, establish relations with teachers who are co-designers, and develop material for classroom teaching and professional development courses. Based on that work, we will work on a position paper describing essential components of data science for secondary students."

The Mobilize project has created and implemented a course for secondary students, Introduction to Data Science (IDS), that aims to develop computational and statistical thinking skills so that students can access and analyze data from a variety of traditional and non-traditional sources. Although the course does not directly address open source data, such data are used in the curriculum, and an outcome of the project is to develop skills and habits of mind that allow students to use open source data to understand their community. This paper introduces the course and describes some of the challenges in its implementation."

ca29080ac76ab8c210952de9b107c28be7ea8c46,teaching parallelism without programming a data science curriculum for noncs students,The goal of our work is to develop an open and modular course for data science and big data analytics that is accessible to non-programmers. The course is designed to cover major concepts that are useful to understand the benefits of parallel and distributed programming while not relying on a programming background. These key concepts focus more on algorithmic aspects rather than architecture and performance issues. A key aspect of our work is the use of workflows to illustrate key concepts and to allow the students to practice.
71b7eaf07fd4acd5cd659912e824985dbe201f68,a datacentric computing curriculum for a data science major,"Many universities are introducing a new major in Data Science into their offering, to reflect the explosive growth in this field and the career opportunities it provides. As a field Data Science has elements from Computer Science and from Statistics, and curricula plans differ widely, both in the balance between the CS and Stats aspects, and also in the emphasis within the computing topics. This paper reports on the curriculum that has been taught for three years now at the University of Sydney. In particular, we describe the approach of a sequence of computing subjects which were developed specifically for the major, in order to bring students over several years to a sophisticated understanding of the data-handling aspects of Data Science. Students also take traditional subjects from both CS (such as Data Structures or AI) and from Statistics (such as Learning from Data and Statistical Inference). The data-centric specially-designed subjects we discuss in this paper are (i) Informatics: Data and Computation (in the first year), (ii) Big Data and Data Diversity (in the second year), and then upper-division subjects on (iii) Data Science Platforms, and (iv) Human-in-the-Loop Data Analytics."
27f45713fd3c41e5a27f667b2897a9662283a0d7,teaching data science in political science integrating methods with substantive curriculum,"ABSTRACT The importance of data science in society today is undeniable, and now is the time to prepare data science talent (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2018). Data science demands collaboration, but collaboration within political science departments has been weak in teaching data science. Bridging substantive and methods courses can critically aid in teaching data science because it facilitates this collaboration. Our innovation is to integrate data science into both substantive and methods courses through a dedicated data science course and modules on data science topics taught in substantive courses. This approach allows not only for more opportunities for teaching and practice of data science methods but also helps students to understand how social, economic, and political biases and incentives can affect their data."
b8c6f3afd1472ae579b9375db625d1cc2532926d,insights for curriculum development identifying emerging data science topics through analysis of qa communities,"Updating curricula in new computer science domains is a critical challenge faced by many instructors and programs. In this paper we present an approach for identifying emerging topics and issues in Data Science by using Question and Answer (Q&A) sites as a resource. Q&A sites provide a useful online platform for discussion of topics and through the sharing of information they become a valuable corpus of knowledge. We applied latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a statistical topic modeling technique, to analyze data science related threads from from two popular Q&A communities ""Stack Exchange and Reddit"". We uncovered both important topics as well as useful examples that can be incorporated into teaching. In addition to technical topics, our analysis also identified topics related to professional development. We believe that approaches such as these are critical in order to update curriculum and bridge the workplace-school divide in teaching of newer topics such as data science. Given the pace of technical development and frequent changes in the field, this is an inventive and effective method to keep teaching up to date. We also discuss the limitations of this approach whereby topics of importance such as data ethics are largely missing from online discussions."

The resulting materials are flexible enough to serve both introductory and advanced students, and aim to provide students with the skills to experiment with data, find their own patterns, and ask their own questions. In this article, we discuss a tutorial on data visualization and a case study synthesizing data wrangling and visualization skills in detail, and provide references to additional class-tested materials. R and R Markdown are used for all of the activities."
3c51a892ce5a8fc78d57ea290c6e5144ee9db579,key concepts for a data science ethics curriculum,"Data science is a new field that integrates aspects of computer science, statistics and information management. As a new field, ethical issues a data scientist may encounter have received little attention to date, and ethics training within a data science curriculum has received even less attention. To address this gap, this article explores the different codes of conduct and ethics frameworks related to data science. We compare this analysis with the results of a systematic literature review focusing on ethics in data science. Our analysis identified twelve key ethics areas that should be included within a data science ethics curriculum. Our research notes that none of the existing codes or frameworks covers all of the identified themes. Data science educators and program coordinators can use our results as a way to identify key ethical concepts that can be introduced within a data science program."
13d2936e2bd3cd0104953fff08dc4823678dd01a,data science in the chemical engineering curriculum,"With the increasing availability of large amounts of data, methods that fall under the term data science are becoming important assets for chemical engineers to use. Methods, broadly speaking, are needed to carry out three tasks, namely data management, statistical and machine learning and data visualization. While claims have been made that data science is essentially statistics, consideration of the three tasks previously mentioned make it clear that it is really broader than just statistics alone and furthermore, statistical methods from a data-poor era are likely insufficient. While there have been many successful applications of data science methodologies, there are still many challenges that must be addressed. For example, just because a dataset is large, does not necessarily mean it is meaningful or information rich. From an organizational point of view, a lack of domain knowledge and a lack of a trained workforce among other issues are cited as barriers for the successful implementation of data science within an organization. Many of the methodologies employed in data science are familiar to chemical engineers; however, it is generally the case that not all the methods required to carry out data science projects are covered in an undergraduate chemical engineering program. One option to address this is to adjust the curriculum by modifying existing courses and introducing electives. Other examples include the introduction of a data science minor or a postgraduate certificate or a Master’s program in data science."

These guidelines are meant to provide some structure for institutions planning for or revising a major in Data Science."
85e960d2c371d43fee5607930aa9c8098f44f971,teaching data science an objective approach to curriculum validation,"ABSTRACT Emerging careers in technology-focused fields such as data science coupled with necessary graduate outcomes mandate the need for a truly interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. However, the rapid pace of curriculum development in this field of inquiry has meant that curricula across universities has largely evolved in line with the internal disciplinary strengths of each institution rather than in response to the needs of graduates. To assist with the development of data science subjects the themes and content that contribute to each subject should be objectively validated. We propose the use of an objective test for data science curricula to quantify whether a particular degree programme maintains an interdisciplinary perspective unconstrained by single discipline bias. The test analyses a given curriculum and quantifies the subject components by category using natural language processing (NLP) techniques."
acbeada51f9beb8fbe3bfa46a89c76b6eba8b71f,interleaving computational and inferential thinking data science for undergraduates at berkeley,"The undergraduate data science curriculum at the University of California, Berkeley is anchored in five new courses that emphasize computational thinking, inferential thinking, and working on real-world problems. We believe that interleaving these elements within our core courses is essential to preparing students to engage in data-driven inquiry at the scale that contemporary scientific and industrial applications demand. This new curriculum is already reshaping the undergraduate experience at Berkeley, where these courses have become some of the most popular on campus and have led to a surging interest in a new undergraduate major and minor program in data science."
222b44bf40c9e5cd1061038077ac0b04c59c5649,interdisciplinarity in data science pedagogy a foundational design,"ABSTRACT Data science is an interdisciplinary field that generates insights in data to aid decision-making. Recognizing that data scientists must be interdisciplinary, agile, and able to adapt to data analysis across many domains, both academia and the industry are striving to integrate interdisciplinary learning and transferable skills into data science curriculum. This paper introduces an interdisciplinary approach to teaching the foundations of data science. We evaluate two different interdisciplinary formats. The first format considers collaborative efforts among instructors with different academic disciplines. The second involves a sole instructor that discusses data science concepts from different disciplines and related to business processes, computer science, and programming. We demonstrate that interdisciplinarity ensures favorable learning experiences and produces high learning outcomes. We also show that our course design maintains and promotes interdisciplinarity even in situations where logistical constraints would not support the use of multiple instructors to deliver one course."

The foundational ideas and techniques of data science are provided independently from technology, allowing students to easily develop a firm understanding of the subject without a strong technical background, as well as being presented with material that will have continual relevance even after tools and technologies change. Using popular data science tools such as Python and R, the book offers many examples of real-life applications, with practice ranging from small to big data. A suite of online material for both instructors and students provides a strong supplement to the book, including datasets, chapter slides, solutions, sample exams and curriculum suggestions. This entry-level textbook is ideally suited to readers from a range of disciplines wishing to build a practical, working knowledge of data science."
eb18ebbecc304a74c366c1cb13f2baf1e9dffcb2,a data science major building skills and confidence,"Data science is a growing field at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise. Like many universities that are building data science degree programs for undergraduates, our small, liberal-arts university saw increasing opportunities in the region and decided to build a data science degree from the ground up, without a pre-existing computer science (CS) department to leverage for courses or culture. We designed and implemented an academically-demanding curriculum that combined mathematics, information systems, and new data science courses, and that also encouraged and supported student success. Each introductory course included active learning design to engage students. To increase retention, all major courses included assignments designed to build skills but also student confidence in their ability to learn challenging technical topics. Outside of the classroom, we created opportunities for professional advancement and developed a technical culture at the university. We will share our approach, course highlights, and lessons learned from building such a curriculum at an institution without a CS department."
da1de6fa2d15e50c9e96811217e27a66313bd762,a first course in data science,"Abstract Data science is a discipline that provides principles, methodology, and guidelines for the analysis of data for tools, values, or insights. Driven by a huge workforce demand, many academic institutions have started to offer degrees in data science, with many at the graduate, and a few at the undergraduate level. Curricula may differ at different institutions, because of varying levels of faculty expertise, and different disciplines (such as mathematics, computer science, and business) in developing the curriculum. The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth started offering degree programs in data science from Fall 2015, at both the undergraduate and the graduate level. Quite a few articles have been published that deal with graduate data science courses, much less so dealing with undergraduate ones. Our discussion will focus on undergraduate course structure and function, and specifically, a first course in data science. Our design of this course centers around a concept called the data science life cycle. That is, we view tasks or steps in the practice of data science as forming a process, consisting of states that indicate how it comes into life, how different tasks in data science depend on or interact with others until the birth of a data product or a conclusion. Naturally, different pieces of the data science life cycle then form individual parts of the course. Details of each piece are filled up by concepts, techniques, or skills that are popular in industry. Consequently, the design of our course is both “principled” and practical. A significant feature of our course philosophy is that, in line with activity theory, the course is based on the use of tools to transform real data to answer strongly motivated questions related to the data."

In this forward thinking article, we discuss the results of a recent large-scale survey on these topics among supply chain management (SCM) professionals, complemented with our experiences in developing, implementing, and administering one of the first master's degree programs in predictive analytics. As such, we effectively provide an assessment of the current state of the field via a large-scale survey, and offer insight into its future potential via the discussion of how a research university is training next-generation data scientists. Specifically, we report on the current use of predictive analytics in SCM and the underlying motivations, as well as perceived benefits and barriers. In addition, we highlight skills desired for successful data scientists, and provide illustrations of how predictive analytics can be implemented in the curriculum. Relying on one of the largest data sets of predictive analytics users in SCM collected to date and our experiences with one of the first master's degree programs in predictive analytics, it is our intent to provide a timely assessment of the field, illustrate its future potential, and motivate additional research and pedagogical advancements in this domain."

Such a gap has significant impact on workforce diversity and inclusion among cross-cutting Biomedical Data Science (BDS) research, which presents great opportunities as well as major challenges for addressing health disparities. This article provides a brief description of the newly established National Institutes of Health Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) diversity initiatives at four universities: California State University, Monterey Bay; Fisk University; University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus; and California State University, Fullerton. We emphasize three main barriers to BDS careers (ie, preparation, exposure, and access to resources) experienced among those pioneer programs and recommendations for possible solutions (ie, early and proactive mentoring, enriched research experience, and data science curriculum development). The diversity disparities in BDS demonstrate the need for educators, researchers, and funding agencies to support evidence-based practices that will lead to the diversification of the BDS workforce."

We discuss (i) briefly the history of project, (ii) a certificate program that we created, (iii) a data-intensive computing course that forms the core of the curriculum and (iv) some of the challenges we faced and how we addressed them. Major goal of the project was to improve the preparedness of our workforce for the emerging data-intensive computing area. We measured this through assessment of student learning on various concepts and topics related to data-intensive computing. We also discuss the best practices in building a data science program. We highlight the importance of external funding support and multi-disciplinary collaborations in the success of the project. The pedagogical resources created for the project are freely available to help educators and other learners navigate the path to learning data science. We expect this paper about our experience will provide a road map for educators who desire to introduce data science in their curriculum."
85cddce02caf67119b5a7cc1f9f065cc1b4e6c91,emergence of data analytics in the information systems curriculum,"As a phenomenon of interest, impact, and import, there is little doubt that the pervasive expansion of data is upon us as Information Systems educators. Concerns and topics such as Data Science, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Business Analytics, and Business Intelligence are now ubiquitous and often situated as being the “next big thing.” Educators and practitioners who identify and resonate with information systems, as a discipline, are watching these developments with interest. With data being both input and output to so many concerns that intersect with the information systems discipline, several themes emerge when considering what curriculum and pedagogy are appropriate. The role, position, location, and shape of data science topics are considered. Curricular approaches are also discussed with an eye to breadth and depth. Fundamental and existential questions are raised concerning the nature of data science and what role the Information Systems discipline can play. We also discuss evidence from cases one involves a student business analytics competition and the other is researching a topic to offer insights as to how information systems knowledge areas can appropriate data science as an integral component of many competencies that are already considering solidly within the canon of IS topics."

8fc0024223ae1760aa7814e6c1c6e1679d35e7bc,expanding research capacity in subsaharan africa through informatics bioinformatics and data science training programs in mali,"Bioinformatics and data science research have boundless potential across Africa due to its high levels of genetic diversity and disproportionate burden of infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS, Ebola virus disease, and Lassa fever. This work lays out an incremental approach for reaching underserved countries in bioinformatics and data science research through a progression of capacity building, training, and research efforts. Two global health informatics training programs sponsored by the Fogarty International Center (FIC) were carried out at the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Mali (USTTB) between 1999 and 2011. Together with capacity building efforts through the West Africa International Centers of Excellence in Malaria Research (ICEMR), this progress laid the groundwork for a bioinformatics and data science training program launched at USTTB as part of the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) initiative. Prior to the global health informatics training, its trainees published first or second authorship and third or higher authorship manuscripts at rates of 0.40 and 0.10 per year, respectively. Following the training, these rates increased to 0.70 and 1.23 per year, respectively, which was a statistically significant increase (p < 0.001). The bioinformatics and data science training program at USTTB commenced in 2017 focusing on student, faculty, and curriculum tiers of enhancement. The program’s sustainable measures included institutional support for core elements, university tuition and fees, resource sharing and coordination with local research projects and companion training programs, increased student and faculty publication rates, and increased research proposal submissions. Challenges reliance of high-speed bandwidth availability on short-term funding, lack of a discounted software portal for basic software applications, protracted application processes for United States visas, lack of industry job positions, and low publication rates in the areas of bioinformatics and data science. Long-term, incremental processes are necessary for engaging historically underserved countries in bioinformatics and data science research. The multi-tiered enhancement approach laid out here provides a platform for generating bioinformatics and data science technicians, teachers, researchers, and program managers. Increased literature on bioinformatics and data science training approaches and progress is needed to provide a framework for establishing benchmarks on the topics."
1a9bc037f093491a718b8821d4b4535004cd1422,a functional approach to data science in cs,"As part of the development of a new interdisciplinary initiative in data science that draws from statistics, mathematics, computer science, and the social sciences, we have developed a new introductory CS course that emphasizes data science and that we refer to as DataCSCi. Unlike other introductory data science courses, such as Berkeley's Data 8, our course retains the broad array of concepts necessary not only to introduce programming principles related to data science, but also to prepare students for the second course in our standard introductory computer science sequence. In particular, the course includes coverage of recursion (numeric and structural), unit testing, linked data structures, and other concepts we rely upon in subsequent courses in computer science. At the same time, we introduce students to a wide variety of techniques and approaches that support them in their subsequent work in data science, including techniques for wrangling, cleaning, and visualizing data. We achieve this combination of breadth and depth through two core approaches: We focus on a spiral ""use then implement"" approach and we focus on a functional model of programming using Scheme/Racket. While Python and R are the most commonly used languages for data science, we find that Scheme works particularly well to introduce students to concepts both complex, like map-reduce, and simple, like list filtering. In this paper, we report on the design of the curriculum, particularly the capstone project and the ways in which we incorporate the burgeoning subfield of data science for social good."
9edfea26f6afa387c791c9a1feefe68f3f8c3fed,managing the innovation process infusing data analytics into the undergraduate business curriculum lessons learned and next steps,"1. INTRODUCTION In this article, the author asserts that the Internet of things, the increased categorization and quantification of business records, and the explosion of social media and user generated content has provided a treasure trove of data that can be transformed into information and ultimately into business insight by the application of analytics (Goh and Sun, 2015), i.e., ""the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions"" (Informs, 2016). In this emerging big data/analytics era, businesses are increasingly looking to the information systems discipline to holistically combine data, programs, experiments, and algorithms to aid in decision-making and ultimately to gain competitive advantage (Wilder and Osgur, 2015). The two key players in this arena are businesses that will lead the transformation and academic institutions that will supply much of the talent necessary for the transformation (Wixom et al., 2014). As of today, in the information systems academic arena, there has been considerable experimentation in creating courses to provide the requisite students skills, but few integrated curriculums, and no dominant design (Topi, 2016). One way to gain insight on how best to fill these gaps is to compare a ""dream"" Business Analytic curriculum put forth by an IS scholar against an actual curriculum model developed at our university (Wang, 2015). Similar to Koch and Kayworth (2009), the author has developed a form of case-based research where the researcher is directly involved in the phenomenon being studied (Baskerville and Wood-Harper, 1996). The author began the curriculum design effort at his university with a situational analysis of what is changing in the emerging data-centric business environment and how this is affecting business demand for analytic talent. This sets the stage for a curriculum audit of existing IS programs and challenges they are facing. The author then presents a proven model of curriculum change that was used, followed by the components of the new Data Analytics major. Next, the author presents the innovation process model that guided the design of the new major and concludes with how the program compares with an ideal curriculum and what has been learned. 2. DATA CENTRIC BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT The amount of data in the world has been exploding, and analyzing large data sets--so-called big data--is becoming a critical basis of competition, underpinning new waves of productivity growth, innovation, and consumer surplus (Manyika et al., 2011). Organizations around the world are struggling to develop the know-how to aggregate, analyze, and most importantly, monetize the growing surge of available data (Heinz, 2016). The domain of big data has been categorized into two broad but related areas: Data Engineering is the finding, organizing, cleaning, sorting and moving of data; and Data Science is about improving decision making from the ever increasing quantity of data and ultimately generating knowledge and insights by extracting value from data. Because the former, data engineering, is performed at the tactical and operational level, and the latter is done more at the analytical and strategic level, this makes designing a comprehensive data analytics major including both difficult. A study of the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2018 there will be 4-5 million jobs in the U.S. requiring data analysis skills--and large numbers of positions will only be filled through training or retraining (Data Society, 2016). This new generation of scientists and engineers must possess a broad range of distinctive skills not present in any one academic department. Therefore, the creation of a comprehensive data analytics curriculum must draw upon at least two central areas: computer science (databases and programming) and analytics (math and forecasting). However, data analytic knowledge is quite useful in a variety of discipline areas in the business school, for instance, forensic accounting, digital marketing, application development, financial engineering, and healthcare administration. …"

This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the efficiency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benefits (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility."

Much of these data are being stored in electronic health records yielding big data that presents challenges for its management and analysis. Here, we review several areas of knowledge that are necessary for next-generation scientists to fully realize the potential of biomedical big data. We begin with an overview of big data and its storage and management. We then review statistics and data science as foundational topics followed by a core curriculum of artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing that are needed to develop predictive models for clinical decision making. We end with some specific training recommendations for preparing next-generation scientists for biomedical big data."

Recent studies demonstrate two critical factors: Persistent stereotypes about ""who does computer science"" can preclude interest in the field for members of these groups; many also perceive computing as ""irrelevant"" and ""asocial"". While these issues must be addressed at multiple ages and levels, many suggest that we should start early, before students have developed stereotypes. As a step in combating (mis-)perceptions of ability and relevance, we developed and conducted a spectrum of week-long summer ""code camps"" for regional middle-school students. These camps emphasize meaningful uses of computing, on building self-efficacy, and on broadening understanding of who does and can do computer science. In this paper, we focus on our ""data science for social good"" (ds4sg) camp, in which students explored computational approaches to data science through a lens of computing for social good, discovering how computing helps them not only better understand societal issues but also convince others to address problems. We discuss the rationale for the curriculum and its content, including our uses of pair programming, personal projects, and a growth model that brings students from block-based programming to professional Jupyter data notebooks. We consider the short-term effects the camps have on students' self-efficacy and perceptions of computer science. We conclude with recommendations and guidelines for those intending to offer similar camps."

The paper explores the inspiration and motivation for creating the undergraduate Data Science program, the program curriculum, and the governing body of the program. We aim to recruit undergraduates, specifically women, into the new major which are underrepresented in Computer Science at our University. We expect that this Major in Data Science will serve as a general framework for establishing similar interdisciplinary programs."
7cb6d4b18fa9a0636263c6cad35c59fe53b0724d,validating curriculum development using text mining,"ABSTRACT Interdisciplinarity requires the collaboration of two or more disciplines to combine their expertise to jointly develop and deliver learning and teaching outcomes appropriate for a subject area. Curricula and assessment mapping are critical components to foster and enhance interdisciplinary learning environments. Emerging careers in data science and machine learning coupled with the necessary graduate outcomes mandate the need for a truly interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. The challenges for emerging academic disciplines such as data science and machine learning center on the need for multiple fields to coherently develop university-level curricula. Using text mining, we empirically analyze the breadth and depth of existing tertiary-level curricula to quantify patterns in curricula through the use of surface and deep cluster analysis. This approach helps educators validate the breadth and depth of a proposed curriculum relative to the broad evolution of data science as a discipline."

Our goal was to create a synthetic dataset and curricular materials to assist in teaching fundamentals of translational data science. Materials and Methods. A literature review was conducted to extract current cardiovascular risk score logic, data elements, and population characteristics. Then, clinical data elements in the models were pulled from clinical data and transformed to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model; genetic data elements were added based on population rates. A hybrid Bayesian network was used to create synthetic data from the logical elements of the risk scores and the underlying population frequencies of the clinical data. Results A synthetic dataset of 446,000 patients was created. A two-day curriculum was created based on this synthetic data with exploratory data analysis and machine learning components. The curriculum was offered on two separate occasions; the two groups of learners were given the curriculum and data, and results were tallied, summarized, and compared. Students’ ability to complete the challenge was mixed; more experienced students achieved a range of 70%-85% in balanced accuracy, but many others did not perform better than the baseline model. Discussion Overall, students enjoyed the course and dataset, but some struggled to consistently apply machine learning techniques. The curriculum, data set, techniques for generation, and results are available for others to use for their own training. Conclusion A realistic synthetic data with clinical and genetic components helps students learn issues in cardiovascular risk scoring, practice data science skills, and compete in a challenge to improve identification of risk."

Our students are united by a desire to learn data science skills and to apply those skills in a specific academic discipline or a corporate partner project. We provide explanations of why an LLC is beneficial; the curriculum (motivated by Nolan and Temple Lang); resources required to coordinate such a community; lessons learned from the first year at a large scale; plans for an assessment and a shared resource repository; and plans for an even more accessible, differentiated learning environment in the future."

As such, it is an essential element of a reproducible workflow that deserves due consideration among the learning objectives of statistics courses. This article describes experiences and implementation decisions of four contributing faculty who are teaching different courses at a variety of institutions. Each of these faculty has set version control as a learning objective and successfully integrated one such system (Git) into one or more statistics courses. The various approaches described in the article span different implementation strategies to suit student background, course type, software choices, and assessment practices. By presenting a wide range of approaches to teaching Git, the article aims to serve as a resource for statistics and data science instructors teaching courses at any level within an undergraduate or graduate curriculum."

Alarmingly not all graduates exit college with what are nothing less than survival skills.The goals of the course curriculum innovation are to raise the awareness of data science, promote retention, increase the interest and curiosity, and boost essential data skills for all students on campus. These goals are similar to existing efforts on the design of introductory data science courses for majors and non-majors. The distinctiveness of this course curriculum resides in hands-on learning by examples, case studies, and team-based projects within a low-stakes format, where students from different disciplines early in their college careers collaborated to ethically solve problems in the repetition of data science life cycles. The Innovative Practice Category Work in Progress paper presents our experience in integrating introductory data science into a college-wide computer and information literacy course via collaborative practices of exemplar and project-based learning. The collaborative learning with wide interdisciplinary focus enriched our pedagogues and scalability. Its effectiveness has been measured in a poster session and student perceptions on 5-point Likert scales. Furthermore, integrating introductory data science into a computer and information literacy course served to optimize existing educational resources and facilitate multiple pathways in college. The methodology and studio-like training shown in the experience report can be expanded to upper-level data science courses."

To develop as leaders in AI-ML, radiology residents may seek a formative data science experience. The authors piloted an elective Data Science Pathway (DSP) for 4th-year residents at the authors' institution in collaboration with the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS). The goal of the DSP was to provide an introduction to AI-ML through a flexible schedule of educational, experiential, and research activities. The study describes the initial experience with the DSP tailored to the AI-ML interests of three senior radiology residents. The authors also discuss logistics and curricular design with common core elements and shared mentorship. Residents were provided dedicated, full-time immersion into the CCDS work environment. In the initial DSP pilot, residents were successfully integrated into AI-ML projects at CCDS. Residents were exposed to all aspects of AI-ML application development, including data curation, model design, quality control, and clinical testing. Core concepts in AI-ML were taught through didactic sessions and daily collaboration with data scientists and other staff. Work during the pilot period led to 12 accepted abstracts for presentation at national meetings. The DSP is a feasible, well-rounded introductory experience in AI-ML for senior radiology residents. Residents contributed to model and tool development at multiple stages and were academically productive. Feedback from the pilot resulted in establishment of a formal AI-ML curriculum for future residents. The described logistical, planning, and curricular considerations provide a framework for DSP implementation at other institutions.

5fb90cc7fbc10e3e752bbcad316cad4a052e7160, nursing knowledge big data science initiative,"O n June 13–15, 2018, inMinneapolis, we witnessed the sixth annual Nursing Knowledge: Big Data Science (NKBD) conference. Just as the original 2013 invitational initiative that attracted nursing professionals from across practice, government policy, software vendors, professional organizations, informatics, academia, and research, 2018's NKBD open conference showed the same diversity as well as growth in numbers. The NKBD Initiative's core mission across these 6 years has stayed the same: to develop a roadmap for achieving “sharable and comparable” nursing data and to ensure the timely adoption of big data methodologies across all of nursing's domains. The 2018 conference kicked off with a powerful set of preconference workshops addressing key work group areas of high-value topics. This year's topics were Hands-On, Full Life Cycle Data Science; Social Media and Mobile Health Analytics; and Streamlining/Transforming EHR Documentation. Conducted so that participants can do hands-on work with new tools or demonstration case studies that give “how to” information, these 3-day–long sessions were jam-packed. The preworkshop evaluations rated the applied learning value of all three sessions as “very high,” with requests for more of the same going forward. The structure of the NKBD conference is primarily to provide a platform for the 10 working groups to report on their accomplishments over the past year. This year's reports demonstrated the considerable evolution that has occurred over these past 6 years and the significant body of work completed and breadth of accomplishments achieved from the 10 working groups. A list of some of the publications generated across the working groups is attached at the end of this article, and a full review is included in conference proceedings. The breadth of the work spans terminology standardization work under Matney/Settergren et al; data analytics and information modeling, Sylvia/Westra et al; nursing value, Welton/ Harper et al; and nursing informatics curriculum standards and resources, Wilson/Manos et al, to list just a few. During the body of the main conference, time allowed working groups to do on-the-ground work, as well as networking and collaborations with other work groups. In a summary session on the afternoon of the last day, work group chairs reported on their go-forward strategies, and this detail can be reviewed in the Resource Center site and conference proceedings."
358643272aa9190e5c9f9adc89e3d0d7eb3dbbe3,modeling and visualizing student flow,"In this work, we present a data science system to model and visualize student flow patterns based on electronic student data of a university. Our system is called eCamp. The datasets used by eCamp were previously disconnected and only maintained and accessed in a siloed manner by independent campus offices. At a campus-level, our models and visualization show how students make choices among hundreds of potential majors, as students gradually progress towards their sophomore, junior, and senior year. At a department-level, the student flow patterns revealed by eCamp show how each course plays a different role within a curriculum. eCamp further dives down to the granularity of the exact classes offered in each semester. At that level, eCamp shows how students navigate from one set of classes in one semester to another set in a subsequent semester. Previously, comprehensive information about student progression patterns at all of these level was simply unavailable. To that end, we also demonstrate how insights into such student flow patterns can support analytical tasks involving student outcomes, student retention, and curriculum design."
3ee0caa92a5c147acc74d64c937beb2450746e33,the school of information and its relationship to computer science at uc berkeley,"There is a polymorphism to Schools of Information that allows for a nimbleness of research that can travel outside of academically normative paths. The fuzzy borders between the school and its nearest departments are a product of the interdisciplinarity of its faculty composition and nature of the problems it takes on. The boundaries of the school are brought into relief as data science curriculum and research grow and the relationship of the school to computer science is necessarily considered. In this paper, we investigate the iSchool’s relationship to Computer Science through the lens of course enrollment behavior of over 160,000 students at UC Berkeley between 2007 and 2015."

We describe the reasoning behind these two concentrations and how these two concentrations came to exist. All Computer Science majors must choose one of these 12 credit hour concentrations after completing the core Computer Science courses. Though there have been many model undergraduate programs and graduate programs in Data Science in the nation [14], [15], [16] we believe that our concentration in Big Data Analytics is a unique offering, especially in our state. The concentration in Big Data Analytics covers predictive analytics, cloud and distributed computing and data mining. The concentration in Software Development follows a modified version of the IEEE/ACM software engineering curriculum recommendations [3]. Both concentrations finish with a semester-long capstone course."
521610cacb3f45f1a42df7e58298020c68177eb9,a survey of statistical capstone projects,"ABSTRACT In this article, we highlight the advantages of incorporating a statistical capstone experience in the undergraduate curriculum, where students perform an in-depth analysis of real-world data. Capstone experiences develop statistical thinking by allowing students to engage in a consulting-like experience that requires skills outside the scope of traditional courses: defining a complex problem, analyzing data, building a strong team, and communicating effectively. We describe the pedagogical benefits as they relate to improved student outcomes and prospective job and graduate school placement, and we classify statistical capstones into four groups: standalone capstone projects, statistical consultancies, capstone projects embedded in an advanced statistics methodology course, and instruction-focused capstone courses. This article serves as a guide for educators seeking to implement an enriching capstone experience in their undergraduate mathematics or statistics curriculum to better prepare students for industrial and academic careers in data science."
80da619d2c3f3c734a3b982a2daeb56d002bbdf8,teaching data science in a statistical curriculum can we teach more by teaching less,"In many universities, Statistics departments have seen a surge of majors and concentrators (or minors) over the past decade. No one would argue that this trend has nothing to do with the increasing popularity of data-driven solutions in both private and public sectors. Statistics is considered being equivalent to (by some), a part of, or overlapping with (by most), Data Science. Most data scientists would also agree that Statistics is central to the foundation of these data-driven products. Students of Statistics, on one hand, regard themselves as having one foot inside data science already, while, on the other hand, experiencing confusion and frustration when they find themselves not as competitive in job interviews or hack-a-thons as their peers from computational sciences. One common “complaint” from statistics students is that they have not been equipped with the latest computational skills and knowledge about big data technologies. As educators, shall we cater to the needs of our students and start teaching them data science skills? Given the fact that data science technologies are ever changing, which “data science skills” shall we be teaching them?Which of our faculty can teach them these data science skills? We cannot have a curriculum for just about everything. The main question here is not “shall we teach them Python or Hadoop?” but “how shall we prepare our Statistics students for a career in Data Science as a Statistician?” Currently,Data Science is a fast-evolving field that represents, in many fields, a new approach of acquiring knowledge, collecting evidence, reasoning decisions, and making predictions, much of which is actually not new to Statistics. The process that produces a data science product can be viewed as a sequence of meticulously engineered decisions (or procedures) for data collection, data processing, data analysis, and result interpretation. While most of current data science efforts have been focused on how to implement these decisions to (or “cope with,” as Dr. Donoho described in his article) Big Data, Statistics primarily concerns about evaluating and improving the validity of these decisions. In his article, “50 Years of Data Science,” Dr. Donoho provided in-depth retrospectives and perspectives on data science, especially in relation to Statistics. He reviewed the evolution of data science as a “science of learning from data.” This definition of data science focuses on what we hope to accomplish and advance, rather than on what we use or study. It also well explains why data science, as a field, while being supported by a set of fundamental principles, evolves quickly with current data collection and processing technology. Many of these"
c0301e6a75b08efa2f6e39c17043b9bd450d78a4,integrating data science ethics into an undergraduate major a case study,"Abstract We present a programmatic approach to incorporating ethics into an undergraduate major in statistical and data sciences. We discuss departmental-level initiatives designed to meet the National Academy of Sciences recommendation for integrating ethics into the curriculum from top-to-bottom as our majors progress from our introductory courses to our senior capstone course, as well as from side-to-side through co-curricular programming. We also provide six examples of data science ethics modules used in five different courses at our liberal arts college, each focusing on a different ethical consideration. The modules are designed to be portable such that they can be flexibly incorporated into existing courses at different levels of instruction with minimal disruption to syllabi. We connect our efforts to a growing body of literature on the teaching of data science ethics, present assessments of our effectiveness, and conclude with next steps and final thoughts."
1b6f3b63c8a2cb1259a89985284e5610d2d0c7b7,developing students written communication skills with jupyter notebooks,"Written communication skills are considered to be highly desirable in computing graduates. However, many computing students do not have a background in which these skills have been developed, and the skills are often not well addressed within a computing curriculum. For some multidisciplinary areas, such as data science, the range of potential stakeholders makes the need for communications skills all the greater. As interest in data science increases and the technical skills of the area are in ever higher demand, understanding effective teaching and learning of these interdisciplinary aspects is receiving significant attention by academics, industry and government in an effort to address the digital skills gap. In this paper, we report on the experience of adapting a final year data science module in an undergraduate computing curriculum to help develop the skills needed for writing extended reports. From its inception, the module has used Jupyter notebooks to develop the students' skills in the coding aspects of the module. However, over several presentations, we have investigated how the cell-based structure of the notebooks can be exploited to improve the students' understanding of how to structure a report on a data investigation. We have increasingly designed the assessment for the module to take advantage of the learning affordances of Jupyter notebooks to support both raw data analysis and effective report writing. We reflect on the lessons learned from these changes to the assessment model, and the students' responses to the changes."

It also provides an engaging context in which to learn computational thinking skills in existing classroom contexts. For my dissertation research, I will explore whether and how data science can support inquiry-based learning in social studies. I conjecture that data science could provide students with an opportunity to use computational thinking to better understand their social world, while also allowing students to draw from and make sense of their own experiences. I plan to explore this idea by enhancing and evaluating a software tool, Local Ground, and creating a curriculum that helps young people identify and describe salient characteristics of their lived realities, moving from unstructured to structured data representations (e.g., photos to tags to databases). This process may generate a rich, motivating data source to explore subsequent ideas in computational thinking and social science."

This is a three-part workshop. Part 1 will outline a curriculum for an introductory data science course and discuss pedagogical decisions that go into the choice of topics and concepts as well as the choice of programming language (R) and syntax (primarily tidyverse), and the emphasis on literate programming for reproducibility (with R Markdown). Part 2 will discuss infrastructure choices around teaching data science with R: RStudio as an integrated development environment, cloud-based access with RStudio Cloud and Server, version control with Git, and collaboration with GitHub. Part 3 will focus on classroom management on GitHub (with ghclass). Workshop attendees will work through several exercises from the course and get first-hand experience with using the tool-chains and techniques described above. While the workshop content will focus on usage of R, many of the pedagogical takeaways will be language agnostic. All workshop content, including teacher facing documentation and student facing course materials, will also be available to participants via datasciencebox.org. Please bring a laptop with you."
3f8e1f99d1dd33a9a6f715c7e51c227944b0fe71,experiences with efficient methodologies for teaching computer programming to geoscientists,"ABSTRACT Computer programming was once thought of as a skill required only by professional software developers. But today, given the ubiquitous nature of computation and data science it is quickly becoming necessary for all scientists and engineers to have at least a basic knowledge of how to program. Teaching how to program, particularly to those students with little or no computing background, is well-known to be a difficult task. However, there is also a wealth of evidence-based teaching practices for teaching programming skills that can be applied to greatly improve learning outcomes and the student experience. Adopting these practices naturally gives rise to greater learning efficiency—this is critical if programming is to be integrated into an already busy geoscience curriculum. This article considers an undergraduate computer programming course, run during the last five years in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. The teaching methodologies that were used each year are discussed, along with the challenges that were encountered and how the methodologies affected student performance. Anonymized student marks and feedback are used to highlight the discussion, and also how the adjustments made to the course eventually resulted in a highly effective learning environment."
95dc26e79fc2ea5d34dad051314fd19bd454349f,bridging the gap between tools for learning and for doing statistics,"Computers have changed the way we think about data and data analysis. While statistical programming tools have attempted to keep pace with these developments, there is room for improvement in interactivity, randomization methods, and reproducible research.In addition, as in many disciplines, statistical novices tend to have a reduced experience of the true practice. This dissertation discusses the gap between tools for teaching statistics (like TinkerPlots, Fathom, and web applets) and tools for doing statistics (like SAS, SPSS, or R). We posit this gap should not exist, and provide some suggestions for bridging it. Methods for this bridge can be curricular or technological, although this work focuses primarily on the technological.We provide a list of attributes for a modern data analysis tool to support novices through the entire learning-to-doing trajectory. These attributes include easy entry for novice users, data as a first-order persistent object, support for a cycle of exploratory and confirmatory analysis, flexible plot creation, support for randomization throughout, interactivity at every level, inherent visual documentation, simple support for narrative, publishing, and reproducibility, and flexibility to build extensions.While this ideal data analysis tool is still a few years in the future, we describe several projects attempting to close the gap between tools for learning and tools for doing statistics. One is curricular, a high school level Introduction to Data Science curriculum. Others are technological, like the experimental LivelyR interface for interactive analysis, the MobilizeSimple R package, and Shiny microworlds.Much of this work was inspired by Biehler (1997), which describes the attributes necessary for a software package for learning statistics. Biehler’s vision has largely come to light, but advancements in computing and ‘data science’ have moved the goalposts, and there is more to learning statistics than before. This work envisions a tool not only encompassing these advancements, but providing an extensible system capable of growing with the times."

Recent studies demonstrate one reason: persistent stereotypes about ""who does computer science"" can cause minority groups to preclude interest in the field. Unfortunately, these stereotypes are not the only threat to diversifying the discipline. Engaging a diverse group of individuals in computer science is unlikely so long as computing curriculum is perceived as ""irrelevant"" and ""asocial/"". Confronting the stigma of triviality applied to computer science, much like approaching student perceptions about who can do computer science, is a necessary step for increasing the perceived applicability of the discipline. As a step in combating the perception that programming curriculum is irrelevant, we developed and ran a week-long summer coding camp for local middle school students that camp applied principles of computing for social good with data science approaches to encourage campers to consider how computing could help them explore societal issues. Throughout the week, campers learned how to extract meaning from their work and gained experience collaborating in pairs to solve problems. In this poster, we discuss the camp curriculum and its emphasis on the applications of computing. We consider the effects of the camp on the self-efficacy of campers and their perceptions of computer science. We then present some recommendations for those intending to conduct similar camps."

Education contains a great quantity of linked data whose key value lies in the connection. However, we do not know how different courses can carry out diversified cooperation in different major curricula. This paper proposes a network modelling approach to curriculum mapping depend on the 11 years’ data of a university curriculum in the United States, using the network structure to study the curriculum connection from a network dynamic perspective, the network models present a visualize pattern with identify relationships and attributes around different courses. We also provide various descriptive statistics analysis data, such as density, average clustering, and number of nodes etc. Using complex network mapping the curriculum pattern of university education provide a gap analysis of a visualization pattern of educational curriculum research."

We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' exposure to introductory data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. Our intent is to support students, regardless of interest and self‐efficacy in coding, in becoming data‐driven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of data‐driven inquiry. Reference is made to the computer science and statistics consensus curriculum frameworks the International Data Science in Schools Project (IDSSP) recently published for secondary school data science or introductory tertiary programs, designed to optimize data‐science accessibility."

Adapting the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Graduate Tracer Survey Questionnaire, the study provided data that were used as basis in the review and revision of the said program. Results of this research may be used to answer the needs of society by adjusting the curriculum to meet the needs of the 21st century learners, help prepare the students not only for the world of work and land relevant employment but also to innovate in the future. Results of the study were utilized to document the employment characteristics, transition to employment and the level of satisfaction of the fifty (50) BSM graduates in terms of the level of satisfaction of the school’s services, learning environment and facilities. The findings revealed that the graduates claimed their pre-service training under the BSM program helped them acquire 21st Century skills and competencies which were not only effective and adequate but also relevant in responding to the demands of their chosen occupations. Providing soft training on applied computer software, forming partnership with software developers, offering foreign language and major courses that merge machine learning and data science were some of the recommendations suggested by the graduates to further improve the BS Mathematics program."
39a5a0fe156e1e8337dabdc48bcc81bf8105cf6f,reading datasets strategies for interpreting the politics of data signification,"All datasets emerge from and are enmeshed in power-laden semiotic systems. While emerging data ethics curriculum is supporting data science students in identifying data biases and their consequences, critical attention to the cultural histories and vested interests animating data semantics is needed to elucidate the assumptions and political commitments on which data rest, along with the externalities they produce. In this article, I introduce three modes of reading that can be engaged when studying datasets—a denotative reading (extrapolating the literal meaning of values in a dataset), a connotative reading (tracing the socio-political provenance of data semantics), and a deconstructive reading (seeking what gets Othered through data semantics and structure). I then outline how I have taught students to engage these methods when analyzing three datasets in Data and Society—a course designed to cultivate student competency in politically aware data analysis and interpretation. I show how combined, the reading strategies prompt students to grapple with the double binds of perceiving contemporary problems through systems of representation that are always situated, incomplete, and inflected with diverse politics. While I introduce these methods in the context of teaching, I argue that the methods are integral to any data practice in the conclusion."

The results of MANOVA analysis based on course information collected from 45 fashion curriculums offered by leading U.S.-based fashion programmes show that: First, fashion programmes, in general, have incorporated some but very limited data science-related courses into the fashion curriculum. Second, school affiliation and programme type are two factors that have statistically significant impacts on fashion programmes’ adoption of data science-related courses to the curriculum. Third, the current fashion curriculums are too rigid to allow more data science components without adding additional credit burdens. The findings call for a more balanced fashion curriculum to develop students’ data science-related skillsets and suggest rethinking the future of fashion education in U.S. colleges."

To address this growth, higher education has identified the importance of cloud computing courses that are practical and compatible with this rapidly changing field. This is especially relevant as cloud services are becoming common computing resources for many new computational approaches and advanced subjects such as machine learning and data science. The ability to incorporate specific components of cloud computing teaching content into a variety of courses has become important. However, the lack of availability of high-quality teaching material that is easy to integrate, when teaching rapidly evolving cloud-related concepts continues to be a challenge for instructors. This working group will try to address this challenge."
66a5762e68a592487a9019c9f0b3724e7c5649ed,the information quality framework for evaluating data science programs,"Designing a new Analytics programF requires not only identifying needed courses, but also tying the courses together into a cohesive curriculum with an overriding theme. Such a theme helps to determine the proper sequencing of courses and create a coherent linkage between different courses often taught by faculty staff from different domains. It is common to see a program with some courses taught by computer science faculty, other courses taught by faculty and staff from the statistics department, and others from operations research, economics, information systems, marketing or other disciplines. Applying an overriding theme not only helps students organize their learning and course planning, but it also helps the teaching faculty in designing their materials and choosing terminology. The InfoQ framework introduced by Kenett and Shmueli provides a theme that focuses the attention of faculty and students on the important question of the value of data and its analysis with flexibility that accommodates a wide range of data analysis topics. In this chapter, we review a number of programs focused on analytics and data science content from an InfoQ perspective. Our goal is to show, with examples, how the InfoQ dimensions are addressed in existing programs and help identify best practices for designing and improving such programs. We base our assessment on information derived from the program’s web site."

The number of such schools has gradually increased during the first half of the 20th century, especially after the Second World War, both in the USA and elsewhere. As information has gained further importance in scientific endeavors and social life, librarianship became a more interdisciplinary field and library schools were renamed as schools of library and information science/ information studies/ information management/information to better reflect the range of education provided. In this paper, we review the major developments in education for library and information science (LIS) and the impact of these developments on the curricula of LIS schools. We then review the programs and courses introduced by some LIS schools to address the data science and data curation issues. We also discuss some of the factors such as ""data deluge"" and ""big data"" that might have forced LIS schools to add such courses to their programs. We conclude by observing that ""data"" has already triggered some curriculum changes in a number of LIS schools in the USA and elsewhere as ""Data Science"" is becoming an interdisciplinary research field just as ""Information Science"" has once been (and still is)."

Is it the new information literacy? Will the ways we teach information literacy limit imaginative ways to teach data literacy? 
With those questions in mind, the Library of New York University Shanghai has explored multiple ways to teach data literacy to undergraduate students through university events, ‘for-class’ instruction and workshops, and online casebooks. (1) We initiated the yearlong series of events titled ‘Lying with Data’, inviting faculty across disciplines to each address one core data literacy question that students of data science may elude. (2) We offered workshops and in-class instruction that are up-to-date with the latest technology and that fit with the curriculum. (3) We created online casebooks on various topics in the data lifecycle, tackling user needs at different levels. Essential to our teaching activities are two core values: ‘let the quality speak for itself’, and ‘outreach by teaching’."

7ae9291b1d853970e4fe0bb457cab34c240f885e,designing data science workshops for dataintensive environmental science research,"Abstract Over the last 20 years, statistics preparation has become vital for a broad range of scientific fields, and statistics coursework has been readily incorporated into undergraduate and graduate programs. However, a gap remains between the computational skills taught in statistics service courses and those required for the use of statistics in scientific research. Ten years after the publication of “Computing in the Statistics Curriculum,” the nature of statistics continues to change, and computing skills are more necessary than ever for modern scientific researchers. In this article, we describe research on the design and implementation of a suite of data science workshops for environmental science graduate students, providing students with the skills necessary to retrieve, view, wrangle, visualize, and analyze their data using reproducible tools. These workshops help to bridge the gap between the computing skills necessary for scientific research and the computing skills with which students leave their statistics service courses. Moreover, though targeted to environmental science graduate students, these workshops are open to the larger academic community. As such, they promote continued learning of the computational tools necessary for working with data, and provide resources for incorporating data science into the classroom."

This workshop introduces the Data Education in Schools project which is designed to educate 3-18 year old learners about data across the curriculum. We will present an interdisciplinary curriculum framework for data education, based on the PPDAC cycle for statistical literacy and adapted for the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence. We will illustrate how values-based authentic problem solving projects related to real world data can integrate curriculum outcomes from computer science, mathematics and the social subjects. We will explain the rationale for the new Data Science qualification for school learners which is now offered by the Scottish Qualifications Authority. Workshop attendees be invited to share information and experiences about data education from their own educational settings and act as critical friends to improve the Data Education in Schools project."

We began a discussion of the role of data science across disciplines, and the role of computing in data science programs, at SIGCSE 16. The session was well attended and the discussion was valuable. Since then, more work has been done and more people are engaged. This BOF will continue the discussion, including welcoming new voices. We will distribute copies of the report of the NSF sponsored workshop on Data Science education and discuss a new initiative to develop curriculum guidelines for data science programs. This initiative will be in its earliest stages by the time SIGCSE meets, so it will be an excellent opportunity to gather impressions about what are critical considerations for any such curriculum effort. We developed a mailing list from the SIGCSE 16 attendees and will use that list to promote the BOF. The BOF will engage SIGCSE participants who have views on the content and role of courses and programs in data science. In addition to the workshop report, we will describe results from an NSF IUSE grant to develop modules for use in many types of courses. These expect to make access to fundamentals elements of data science available as widely as possible. With these as a starting point, participants in the Birds of a Feather session will explore the emerging field of data science and its relationship to computer science education.

The Open Data Literacy (ODL) project is working to prepare students to build infrastructure and to curate and sustain open data resources for the public by advancing data curation and data science curriculum and providing field experiences in collaboration with city and state agencies. To determine the expertise students need to meet workforce demands, we are examining the current data challenges faced by these public sector organizations. Based on the first year of student field experiences, we found that data organization and access, data quality, and data visualization were prominent areas of competency needed across the sites. While these areas are captured to some degree in current frameworks meant to catalog “data expertise” we find that additional competencies are required, in particular the need for developing and following metadata standards, evaluation and use of storage and cloud services, APIs, law and ethics, and public sector and not‐for‐profit organization knowledge. In future work these emerging areas of data expertise will be prioritized and deepened in our curriculum and better articulated for application in data education more generally."

This paper provides a working definition of Data Science and examines the relationship between this emerging field and other, more familiar disciplines already established in the undergraduate curriculum. We then provide an operational framework (“The Six Steps”) for an introductory course in Data Science and Visualization. We provide a comprehensive description of concrete, relevant example assignments that fit cleanly into this framework. We conclude with examples of how this course can achieve secondary objectives of delivering an opportunity for emphasis on Writing and Information Literacy."
11f9db824dba76fe931b3f0863c6f80ce85568c3,expanding the scope of statistical computing training statisticians to be software engineers,"Abstract Traditionally, statistical computing courses have taught the syntax of a particular programming language or specific statistical computation methods. Since Nolan and Temple Lang’s seminal paper, we have seen a greater emphasis on data wrangling, reproducible research, and visualization. This shift better prepares students for careers working with complex datasets and producing analyses for multiple audiences. But, we argue, statisticians are now often called upon to develop statistical software, not just analyses, such as R packages implementing new analysis methods or machine learning systems integrated into commercial products. This demands different skills. We describe a graduate course that we developed to meet this need by focusing on four themes: programming practices, software design, important algorithms and data structures, and essential tools and methods. Through code review and revision, and a semester-long software project, students practice all the skills of software engineering. The course allows students to expand their understanding of computing as applied to statistical problems while building expertise in the kind of software development that is increasingly the province of the working statistician. We see this as a model for the future evolution of the computing curriculum in statistics and data science."

However, students at institutions with limited resources have received relatively little exposure to curricula or professional development opportunities that lead to careers in genomic data science. To broaden participation in genomics research, the scientific community needs to support these programs in local education and research at underserved institutions (UIs). These include community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal colleges and universities that support ethnically, racially, and socioeconomically underrepresented students in the United States. We have formed the Genomic Data Science Community Network to support students, faculty, and their networks to identify opportunities and broaden access to genomic data science. These opportunities include expanding access to infrastructure and data, providing UI faculty development opportunities, strengthening collaborations among faculty, recognizing UI teaching and research excellence, fostering student awareness, developing modular and open-source resources, expanding course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), building curriculum, supporting student professional development and research, and removing financial barriers through funding programs and collaborator support."

AutoML, when implemented properly, makes machine learning accessible to most people because it removes the need for years of experience in the most arcane aspects of data science, such as the math, statistics, and computer science skills required to become a top contender in traditional machine learning. Anyone trained in the use of AutoML can use it to test their ideas and support the quality of those ideas during presentations to management and stakeholder groups. Because the requisite investment is one semester-long undergraduate course rather than a year in a graduate program, these tools will likely become a core component of undergraduate programs, and over time, even the high school curriculum."

4ff6d24e73144aaded19ec10e2cadb8c61cd1cd8,collective development of large scale data science products via modularized assignments an experience report,"Many universities are offering data science (DS) courses to fulfill the growing demands for skilled DS practitioners. Assignments and projects are essential parts of the DS curriculum as they enable students to gain hands-on experience in real-world DS tasks. However, most current assignments and projects are lacking in at least one of two ways: 1) they do not comprehensively teach all the steps involved in the complete workflow of DS projects; 2) students work on separate problems individually or in small teams, limiting the scale and impact of their solutions. To overcome these limitations, we envision novel synergistic modular assignments where a large number of students work collectively on all the tasks required to develop a large-scale DS product. The resulting product can be continuously improved with students' contributions every semester. We report our experience with developing and deploying such an assignment in an Information Retrieval course. Through the assignment, students collectively developed a search engine for finding expert faculty specializing in a given field. This shows the utility of such assignments both for teaching useful DS skills and driving innovation and research. We share useful lessons for other instructors to adopt similar assignments for their DS courses."

The rise of data science has coincided with a broadening audience for learning statistics and using computational packages and tools. It has also increased the need for communication skills. We argue that, for most of this audience, instruction should focus on foundational concepts and the early introduction of different types of data and modern methods through the use of interactive learning environments without programming prerequisites. We then describe Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE), a web-based e-learning platform and lesson authoring framework for teaching statistics. Built on top of computing and peer-to-peer technology, the platform allows collaborative data analysis and real-time interactions in the classroom. We describe how ISLE contributes to the three key Nolan and Temple Lang components: broadening the statistical computing curriculum, deepening computational reasoning and literacy, and expanding computing with data in the practice of statistics. We then present several advantages of using a computing-integrated environment such as ISLE, including promoting (cross-disciplinary) communication, supporting classroom-focused integrated development environments, and advancing the science of data science."

Under the new situation of ""double first-class"" construction of national higher education, how can Local Application-oriented Universities scientifically position the talent training objectives of big data major, reasonably set up talent training programs, accurately grasp the talent demand of the industry, cultivate technical talents to meet the needs of social and economic development, and promote the sustainable development of the major according to their own teaching resources and school running conditions, It is the first problem that must be considered in the specialty construction. Taking Ordos Institute of applied technology as an example, this paper explores the talent training system of data science and big data technology major from six aspects of talent training objectives, curriculum system structure, teaching staff construction, teaching research and reform, practical teaching and school enterprise cooperation, so as to provide reference for the talent training reform and development of big data major in Application-oriented brother colleges."

These programs are aimed at training scientists and engineers to tackle problems requiring interdisciplinary approaches to finding solutions to scientific and engineering problems and the development of new computing, as exemplified by the co-design approach to exascale architectures and applications. Thus, the programs emphasize preparation in applied mathematics, numerical analysis, and scientific computing in addition to science and engineering work relevant to the target application. The rise of so-called ""Big-Data"" applications and the use of large data in business decision support and even in computational science workflows like uncertainty analysis are driving a need for training in data sciences. This paper makes the argument that, rather than treating topics in machine learning, statistics, etc. as stand-alone fields of study that students learn as electives, data-science should be an integral part of interdisciplinary training for future researchers. This approach is at the core of the newly developed Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDSE) Ph.D. program at the University of Buffalo. This paper describes the development of the Ph.D. program, the target student audience, and strategies for effectively executing the proposed curriculum."

Yet it can be a challenge to fit the teaching of such skills into the data science curriculum. Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a pedagogical strategy that can help educators teach data science better by flipping the classroom to employ small-group collaborative learning to actively engage students in doing data science. A consequence of this teaching method is helping students achieve the workforce-relevant data science learning goals of effective communication, teamwork, and collaboration. We describe the essential elements of TBL: accountability structures and feedback mechanisms to support students collaborating within permanent teams on well-designed application exercises to do data science. The results of our case study of using TBL to teach a modern, introductory data science course indicate that the course effectively taught reproducible data science workflows, beginning R programming, and communication and collaboration. Students also reported much room for improvement in their learning of statistical thinking and advanced R concepts. To help the data science education community adopt this appealing pedagogical strategy, we outline steps for deciding on using TBL, preparing and planning for it, and overcoming potential pitfalls when using TBL to teach data science."

However, not all instructors are versed in data science skills or research-based teaching practices. We surveyed biological and environmental science instructors (n = 106) about the teaching of data science in higher education, identifying instructor needs and illuminating barriers to instruction. Our results indicate that instructors use, teach, and view data management, analysis, and visualization as important data science skills. Coding, modeling, and reproducibility were less valued by the instructors, although this differed according to institution type and career stage. The greatest barriers were instructor and student background and space in the curriculum. The instructors were most interested in training on how to teach coding and data analysis. Our study provides an important window into how data science is taught in higher education biology programs and how we can best move forward to empower instructors across disciplines."

Despite the advances in technology and the availability of data, social work organizations routinely encounter data-related problems that have an impact on their opportunities for making data-driven decisions. Although training in research methods and statistics is important for social work students, these courses often do not address the needs organizations face in collecting, managing, and using data for data-driven decision making. In this teaching note, we propose innovating the social work curriculum using a data science framework as a way to address the day-to-day challenges organizations face regarding data.

The number of students pursuing undergraduate degrees in computer science or related field continues to grow but is still not pacing industry growth. Employers repeatedly suggest that good professional and technical competencies, including ""soft skills"", are a major factor in both obtaining and succeeding in STEM careers. Moreover, both the Council on Graduate Studies and the National Science Board in the NSF 2018 STEM Trends report support the need of such skills for success in STEM. These competencies comprise (1) communication, oral and written, and in technical, business and general settings; (2) working in and leading teams, in varying roles; (3) managing business and professional relationships; (4) planning, problem solving, and critical thinking; (5) mathematical capabilities including numeracy; and (6) an understanding of ethical, social, managerial, and economic perspectives; plus, responding to recent developments in science and science careers, (7) an interdisciplinary perspective and overview understanding of data science.

aba453dfdf23fffe3c4b8cdcc4eb6e706ed0ab7e,job qualifications study for data science and big data professions,"PurposeThe lack of clarity in defining data science is problematic in both academia and industry because the former has a need for clarity to establish curriculum guidelines in their work to prepare future professionals, and the latter has a need for information to establish clear job description guidelines to recruit professionals. This lack of clarity has resulted in job descriptions with significant overlap among different related professional groups. This study examines the industry view of five professions: statistical analysts (SAs), big data analytics professionals (BDAs), data scientists (DSs), data analysts (DAs) and business analytics professionals (BAs). The study compares the five fields with the unified backdrop of their common semantic dimensions and examines their recent dynamics.Design/methodology/approach1,200 job descriptions for the five Big Data professions (SA, DS, BDA, DA and BA) were pulled from the Monster website at four points in time, and a document library was created. The collected job qualification records were analyzed using the text analytic method of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSAs), which extract topics based on observed text usage patterns.FindingsThe findings indicated a good alignment between the industry view and the academic view of data science as a blend of statistical and programming skills. This industry view remained relatively stable during the 4 years of our study period.Originality/valueThis research paper builds upon a long tradition of related studies and commentaries. Rather than relying on subjective expertise, this study examined the job market and used text analytics to discern a space of skill and qualification dimensions from job announcements related to five big data professions."

This has shifted major challenges in biological research from data generation and processing to interpretation and knowledge translation. However, post-secondary training in bioinformatics, or more generally data science for life scientists, lags behind current demand. In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has potential to improve research and learning outcomes and better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated co-curricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants, postdocs, instructors and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems. Preliminary survey results indicate that even a single module improves student self-reported interest and/or experience in bioinformatics and computer science. Thus, EDUCE provides a flexible and extensible active learning framework for integration of data science curriculum into undergraduate courses and programs across the life sciences.

3a003ac1fbfaa2941ed076aecbccd588327b1e7c,the second course in statistics design and analysis of experiments,"Statistics departments are facing rapid growth in enrollments and increases in demand for courses. This article discusses the use of design and analysis of experiments (DAE) as a nonterminal second course in statistics for undergraduate statistics majors, minors, and other students seeking exposure to the practice of statistics beyond the introductory course. DAE is a gateway to approaching statistical thinking as data-based problem solving by exposing students to statistical, computational, data, and communication skills in the second course. Given the somewhat antiquated view of design and deemphasis of classical design of experiments topics in the new ASA curriculum guidelines, DAE may seem an odd choice for the second course; however, it exposes students to the breadth of the statistical problem-solving process, explores foundational issues of the discipline, and is accessible to students who have not yet finished their advanced mathematical training. These skills remain essential in the data science era as students must be equipped to understand the potential and peril of found data using the principles of design. While DAE may not be the appropriate second course for all statistics programs, it provides a strong foundation for causal inference and experimental design for students pursuing a B.S. in Statistics in a program housed in a department of statistics.

In 2019, 12 percent of the workforce was African American, while only 7 percent of STEM workers were African American with a bachelor’s degree or higher. Hispanic share of the workforce increased to 18 percent by 2019; Hispanics with a bachelor’s degree or higher are only 8 percent of the STEM workforce [1]. Although some strides have been made in integrating CDS competencies into the university curriculum, the pace of change has been slow resulting in a critical shortage of sufficiently qualified students at both the baccalaureate and graduate levels. The NSF Working Group on Realizing the Potential of Data Science final report recommends “strengthening curriculum at EPSCoR and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) so students are prepared and competitive for employment opportunities in industry and academia” [2]. However, the resource constraints and large teaching loads can impede the ability of MSIs and smaller institutions to quickly respond and make the necessary curriculum changes. Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) in collaboration with Bethune Cookman University (B-CU), Clark Atlanta University (CAU), Morgan State University (Morgan), Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA), Southern University and A&M College (SUBR), and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM) are piloting a Computational and Data Science Curriculum Exchange (C 2 Exchange) to address the challenges associated with sustained access to computational and data science courses in institutions with high percentage enrollment of students from populations currently under-represented in STEM disciplines. The goal of the C 2 Exchange pilot is to create a network for resource constrained institutions to share CDS courses and increase their capacity to offer CDS minors and certificate programs. Over the past three years we have found that the exchange model facilitates the sharing of curriculum and expertise across institutions for immediate implementation of some courses and long-term capacity building for new Computational and Data Science programs and minors."
af7bae305b3921401eaca6ab3231c87617e59ea0,data assignments in substantive courses getting undergraduates excited and interested in data science,"Teaching undergraduate methods is a difficult task in a major in which there are many mathand science-phobic students. Nevertheless, a foundation in scientific thinking, an understanding of basic statistics, and an introduction to data and principles of data science and its utility should be required curriculum and competency for a bachelor’s degree in political science. To achieve this, I transformed my undergraduate public opinion and electoral behavior course into one that emphasizes and teaches students the power of data in understanding the political and social world. It is important that social science methods training be integrated into substantive courses. Working with data is different from passively observing data presented during a lecture or in a reading, and data are more interesting when they are connected to substantive questions. Therefore, the course provides a social science methodological foundation in the principles of science (i.e., observation and comparison) in a concrete way connected to an interesting subject. Students complete the course not only with more knowledge of the subject than in traditional formats but also with self-confidence and competence in manipulating data in basic ways and asking and answering questions with simple statistics. We begin each substantive topic by engaging in typical pedagogical approaches—lectures, readings, and discussions— but follow up with a lab assignment that substantively reinforces what we learned in class. Lab assignments must build on one another and must consider the students’ ability and experience. In my experience, we can assume that majors have little knowledge or understanding of data, statistics, and the social scientific method, even if they have taken a course in one or all of those subjects. These students often are hesitant about numbers and often seem to have difficulty using their computer beyond basic email skills. Therefore, I assume that the lowest common denominator is no previous data or statistics course. It is important to remember that when students are learning about data science, there are many moving parts: computer program, computer code, syntax files, output files, data files, reading output, understanding output, writing about and discussing data, and applying it to the real world. These parts are all complex and multifaceted, and students need to learn through repetition and continuous interaction with the material—otherwise, they are overwhelmed. Simply stated, data analysis is difficult. Students do understand concepts such as averages and frequencies, which provide an initial toolkit to work with while they learn to manipulate data and become comfortable working within a program. Therefore, I start simple and become more complex. During the first lab assignment, some students are completely lost and frustrated, but they endure. By the third lab assignment, they can begin without assistance from the instructor. By the sixth and final lab assignment, students tell me they are adding these skills to their resumés. I use class time for working on labs and I provide extensive office hours to foster student success. Students do not feel comfortable asking for help, which is why in-class homework time is essential. As the teacher, I must actively engage with students, review their work, help them see small errors, and provide ongoing feedback and encouragement. Students are given all of the lab output related to assignments in a PDF document along with the assignment so that they can be sure that their results are correct. This reduces the number of errors that they make. For each assignment, students must turn in their syntax file, lab answers, and appropriate data output. This is important: I do not want a data dump of every action they took and I do not want summary information about the variable in question if it is not relevant. Looking at the data and knowing which results to include to answer a question are important aspects of learning about how to use data to understand the political world. Their syntax file and corresponding output also are important for finding mistakes and ensuring that the syntax would produce the outcomes that the students present. Because students have the expected output in a PDF file, they simply can cut and paste the answers. When I see mismatches between the syntax file and a student’s output file, I know something is wrong and I speak with the student. After each lab assignment is graded and returned to the students, I have a session inwhich I review the lab answers. An essential component of the course is teaching data literacy, and how to describe data and results is a critical part of that. Talking about and describing data in words is difficult. Students typically are unspecific and tell the reader to look at their output, which is not data literacy and is unacceptable. They often talk about point differences across categories as simply"
32e42267726f57b53179ede7a410888fd32b1362,cyberambassadors results from pilot testing a new professional skills curriculum,"The CyberAmbassadors Project (NSF #1730137) is a training grant to develop professional skills curriculum (communications, teamwork, leadership) to build capacity in Cyber Infrastructure (CI) Professionals. CI Professionals are experts at high performance computing, data science algorithms, and/or supercomputing infrastructure; they are often called upon to work with experts from STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) in multi-disciplinary teams to solve complex problems. The CyberAmbassadors training program seeks to improve the function of these teams by helping CI Professionals build and practice skills for effective communication, teamwork and leadership within the context of complex, multidisciplinary research. This paper summarizes the results of the pilot testing of the CyberAmbassadors curriculum, which was conducted at institutions across the United States using both in-person, online and hybrid delivery methods. A Kirkpatrick evaluation model was used to assess expectations and reasons for participation, as well as satisfaction with the training and impacts on participants’ learning and behavior. The curriculum was revised based on these initial pilot tests, and 43 volunteers have participated in “train the trainers” workshops to prepare to facilitate this training on a larger scale during 2019-20."

We study an example of public engagement on the ethics of combining and analysing data in national government – often called data science ethics. We study hidden assumptions, drawing
 on hidden curriculum theories in education research, as it allows us to identify conscious and unconscious underlying processes related to conducting public engagement that may impact results. Through participation in the 2016 Public Dialogue for Data Science Ethics in the UK, four key themes
 were identified that exposed underlying publicengagement norms. First, that organizers had constructed a strong imagined public as neither overly critical nor supportive, which they used to find and engage participants. Second, that official aims of the engagement, such as including publics
 in developing ethical data regulations, were overshadowed by underlying meta-objectives, such as counteracting public fears. Third, that advisory group members, organizers and publics understood the term 'engagement' in varying ways, from creating interest to public inclusion. And finally,
 that stakeholder interests, particularly government hopes for a positive report, influenced what was written in the final report. Reflection on these underlying mechanisms, such as the development of meta-objectives that seek to benefit government and technical stakeholders rather than publics,
 suggests that the practice of public engagement can, in fact, shut down opportunities for meaningful public dialogue."
bc529ccd7046525feaa402ab49b0fbebca6a6238,computer science,"— Possible for science itself, conceptually, to have and will understand differently, let alone science also seen as technology, such as computer science. After all, science and technology are viewpoints diverse by either individual, community, or social. Generally, it depends on socioeconomic capabilities. So it is with computer science has become a phenomenon and fashionable, where based on the stream of documents, various issues arise in either its theory or implementation, adapting different communities, or designing curriculum holds in the education system. Generally, there are gaps between rich and poor, masculine and feminine, and basic sciences, engineering, and social sciences in accessing and using computer science. In particular, there have been various developments in hardware, software, and brain-ware from computer science in the application. There are recurring problems shortly, in the same or different places, both in developed and technologically lagging countries. Although computer science is still new, it has provided various innovations through research, which is proven by many documents. Therefore, following the growth of computer science - documents in the reputable indexed database, Scopus - there are clues for showing the trends. That is, dividing documents into three-time sessions: sloping, increasing and decreasing. That is by using a growth graphic. Then equip it with some parameters: topics and the weights from hit counts of databases. It gives the meaning as an interpretation to support the reviews. Therefore, this paper will provide a commentary related to that growth. It is for showing that despite the spread of studies, at the last time-session, the issues were always present simultaneously at the same time in accumulation. That is for describing a study title of computer science about what the world already has, going, and will understand about computer science. It is a view regarding its philosophy, basic science, applications, and technology as concepts and solutions that make computer science the primary foundation for skills and professions in the 21 st century through the education system. Therefore, other scientific fields such as informatics, computer engineering, information science, information technology, and data science, which are at the crossroads of computer science, are also scientific fields that raise different issues."

Another trend in education is Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) from leading universities or companies, such as Microsoft, Google, Dell Technologies, etc. Also many vendors (hardware and software companies) made its training available for lay public for free through traditional e-learning systems or through some sort of academic partnership with education institutions. Thus it is possible to enrich traditional academic curriculum with experts' output from industry and other academic organizations. In this paper we describe the possibility of creation data science curriculum with such resources that can be considered as another step to creation of global educational partnership that we can call as Global University."
bba0a3953e3bd98aac3ffb4cc7df5509081947fa,assessing learning behavior and cognitive bias from web logs,"This research to practice, work in progress paper presents the analysis strategy used to assess the learning behavior using logs on an e-learning platform. Students who can link algebraic functions to their corresponding graphs perform well in STEM courses. Early algebra curricula teaches these concepts in tandem. However, it is challenging to assess whether students are linking the concepts. Video analyses, interviews and other traditional methods that aim to quantify how students link the concepts taught in school require precious classroom and teacher time. We use web logs to infer learning. Web logs are widely available and amenable to data science. Our approach partitions the web interface into components related to data and graph concepts. We collect click and mouse movement data as users interact with these components. We used statistical and data mining techniques to model their learning behavior. We built our models to assess learning behavior for a workshop presented in Summer 2016. Students in the workshop were middle-school math teachers planning to use this curriculum in their own classrooms. We used our models to assess participation levels, a prerequisite indicator for learning. Our models aligned with ground-truth traditional methods for 17 of 18 students. The results of the models with respect to the two types of components of the web portal have been used to infer possible data or graph oriented cognitive bias."

The vast amount of data and the competitive advantage of analysing triggers the digital transformations throughout many industries. Despite the towering demands of data science, there seem to be a lack of skilled professionals. Analysing this pressing issue, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the academia-industry interlude and reviewing the status-quo of technical and managerial skills in diverse industries. To study this gap, we collected job descriptions of over 200 companies and then comparing them with the curriculum findings corresponding to 100 institutional courses and professional certification trainings and closely studying the composition of technical and managerial skills required by different industries. Our research summarises the findings and inferences regarding gaps and potential amends that exist in in the domain of data science as well as suggestions on how to bridge the gap indicating industry-specific skillset that are of highlighted significance."
443155f163c9c841ed6b5b84b12bbf3d341f4455,engaging everyone with open data science,"Teaching of statistics should focus more on practical data science, with a special emphasis on data wrangling: Preparing the data for the analyses, looking at the data via clever visualizations, and learning the principles and practices of open science and reproducible research. The statistics curriculum should be updated and the term “data science” used as a synonym to statistics. In all possible fields, there is a huge need to have more data scientists. To engage everyone with “open data science” (open data, open science, and data science), we have created a new course, where students from all levels and fields work together and share their ideas with openly available data sets and freely available state-of-the-art software tools, such as RStudio, R Markdown, and GitHub. The new course has been quite successful in engaging extremely heterogeneous groups of students to challenge themselves to a “next level” by learning new skills of open data science."
b56cf6d567fbce29bfae786a20cbd133f8b56d2e,using learning trajectories for teacher learning to structure professional development,"ABSTRACT As a result of the increased focus on data literacy and data science across the world, there has been a large demand for professional development in statistics. However, exactly how these professional development opportunities should be structured remains an open question. The purpose of this paper is to describe the first iteration of a design experiment involving Project-SET (www.project-set.com) professional development program. Project-SET provided professional development to enhance teachers’ understanding of statistics concepts. The project constructed two learning trajectories for teacher learning and subsequently used the learning trajectories to structure the professional development curriculum. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate how the utilization of the teacher-learning trajectories to structure the professional development allowed participating teachers to develop several aspects of Statistics Knowledge for Teaching (Groth, 2013)."

The core idea of the suggested model is that data science programs in information schools are unique due to their particular substantive expertise, which includes data management, information behavior, and ethics. This paper also suggests that, to create a data science program within an information school, it may be useful to expand curriculums by adding programming, statistics, and machine learning requirements."

It is followed by the construction of data science and engineering major in various universities, and this major is related to the disciplines of data science, computer science, mathematics and engineering management, and also a practice-oriented discipline. These reasons make very high demands on the training of talents in the data science and engineering major. Based on analysis features of the data science and engineering major and the goals that the professional needs, in this paper we discusses the basic skills that the talents should have, and pushes back to the construction of the professional curriculum system of data science and engineering major. Through the analysis method of this paper, we have completed to setting the course system of data science and engineering major and discussed the methods and the ways in the implementation of the curriculum system."
03cf20ff07d545fb671d1acf6d172a4aa4320ef4,a comparative study of the academic programs between informaticsbioinformatics and data science in the us,"As Data Science has recently become a trend of the innovation of building new academic programs in the U.S. higher education, a holistic review and analysis of the curriculum development in a close field called Informatics or Bioinformatics, occurred more than a decade ago, seems to be beneficial and necessary in helping and supporting the healthy growth of Data Science programs. In this paper, a thorough comparative study between Informatics and Data Science was presented through comparing and investigating the similarities and differences of their curriculum structures, bodies of domain knowledge, technical skill sets, research areas, faculty preparation, student background, as well as the lessons learnt from the development of Informatics programs and challenges in developing Data Science programs. It is believed that the recommendations drawn from this study will assist educators to build their Data Science programs with the confidence and determination but without hesitation and fear of misstepping along the way in promoting and building their new programs."

2cc7ff3c86e6c3ebaa2bf4bca9ccb6008183c834,data literacy as a metaskill options for data science curriculum implementation,"Data science is affecting an increasingly wide area of everyday life but general education in Russia has not yet reacted to the new challenges associated with this aspect of digitalization. The changes in technologies, the economy, and society over the last two decades have formed a new agenda for teaching mathematics and information technologies, as well as media education and social sciences. Education in all these fields requires a reconsideration of the content and methods of teaching due to the increasing importance of data science and artificial intelligence in the context of fundamental changes in the economy and the labor market. As many areas of human life are changing, there is a need to formulate new types and kinds of educational results, at which modern pedagogy should be aimed. A modern way of meeting such challenges is to distinguish new literacies (media literacy, environmental literacy, functional literacy, etc.). The article deals with the concept of data literacy, examines its content and composition, and substantiates its relevance as an educational result consistent with digitalization trends that one can observe in modern society. A distinction is made between approaches to in-depth and general studies of data science. A description is given of various types of tasks aimed at developing data literacy among students in the context of their setting on different educational material. The authors consider possible ways of deploying programs aimed at mastering data science by students without the need to formalize it into a separate discipline or school subject."
90fcd88403ad0827c4f1180abc5eebff55ab10fd,data detectives a data science program for middle grade learners,"Abstract Data science is a highly interdisciplinary field that comprises various principles, methodologies, and guidelines for the analysis of data. The creation of appropriate curricula that use computational tools and teaching activities is necessary for building skills and knowledge in data science. However, much of the literature about data science curricula focuses on the undergraduate university level. In this study, we developed an introductory data science curriculum for an out of school enrichment program aimed at middle grade learners (ages 11–13). We observed how the participants in the program (n = 11) learned data science practices through the combination of nonprogramming activities and programming activities using the language R. The results revealed that participants in the program were able to investigate statistical questions of their creation, perform data analysis using statistics and the creation of data visuals, make meaning from their results, and communicate their findings. These results suggest that a series of learner-centered nonprogramming and programming activities using R can facilitate the learning of data science skills for middle-school age students."

Our work contributes an example of successful integration of business and engineering curriculum using foundational themes transcending disciplinary boundaries. The themes that connect the topics are model thinking augmented by data science and design thinking augmented by agile development and lean business and product development processes. Our approach leverages these themes to develop innovators using the disciplines of computer science, software engineering, and management. We offer as an example a successful implementation of this approach, the Jeffrey S. Raikes School, at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln."

It is also a recent professional field which requires experts with knowledge in Statistics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and specific Business Models. Organizations that pursue data intelligence consider Data Science professionals immensely relevant. However, universities and higher education institutions are starting to offer undergraduate programs and courses for Data Science education. In this sense, EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) is presented as a relevant framework to further the education of Data Science Professionals. Thus, this article addresses the integration of EDSF with ADDIE Model, an instructional design model, capable of enabling the construction of an Instructional System (IS). Based on the Learning Outcomes (LO) of the EDSF Model Curriculum Data Science (MC-DS), the article proposes an integrated approach of these LOs along with the phases of ADDIE Model supporting the construction of a Data Science Instructional System (DSIS). This integrated approach assists the understanding of the development of a DSIS and its learning objects, with its technological needs, such as: hardware environment, programming environments (IDEs, scripts, etc.), database models (SQL and NoSQL), massive data storage and processing tools, visualization tools, among others."
483200cf14d6f01834a0fc09c0f699e352787fdf,teaching machine learning for the physical sciences a summary of lessons learned and challenges,"This paper summarizes some challenges encountered and best practices established in several years of teaching Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences at the undergraduate and graduate level. I discuss motivations for teaching ML to physicists, desirable properties of pedagogical materials, such as accessibility, relevance, and likeness to real-world research problems, and give examples of components of teaching units. 1. ML x Physical Sciences Machine learning methods have become ubiquitous in many data-intensive disciplines, including, of course, Physics and Astronomy. The Physical sciences offer a rich landscape of observational and simulated data that are suitable to be analyzed using machine learning and deep learning tools. Identifying particles produced in collision events at the Large Hadron Collider, processing astronomical images from large surveys, identifying transient phenomena in real time, creating fast approximated solutions for lattice theories, or building “emulators” for expensive cosmological simulations are just some of the uses that have become popular in the last decade (see e.g. Carleo et al. 2019 for a review). It follows as a logical consequence that the foundations of machine learning methods should be taught as part of the standard Physics curriculum. In part, this is because they are bound to become standard tools for Physics research. Even more importantly, they are a great pedagogical tool to stimulate critical thinking and to build transferable skills that can create better job perspective for Physics graduates, by leveraging the enormous growth of jobs in the Data Science area that are accessible to those with a rigorous scientific background and strong computational skills. 1 Physics Department, NYC College of Technology, 300 Jay Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA Center for Computational Astrophysics, Flatiron Institute, New York, NY 10010, USA.

Teaching ML to physicists There are many great learning resources that either low-cost or free. These include excellent books with free online Jupyter notebooks (Géron, 2019; VanderPlas, 2016), courses on online platforms like Coursera or Udemy, and chances to practice on fairly complex data sets such as those hosted by Kaggle. However, the abundance of choices can be overwhelming for beginner practitioners, who would have to “mix-and-match” different resources to create a curriculum, and more importantly, resources that are tailored to the process of scientific research, and, in particular, to the physical sciences, are still scarce; (Ivezić et al., 2014) is a happy exception, focused on Astronomy. Furthermore, if we want machine learning to become a standard part of the Physics curriculum, we need to provide resources for instructors: many of them won’t have been trained in this subject during their own course of study, so that lowering the barrier for teaching is as important than lowering the barrier for learning. Five years ago, I started creating materials for a “ML for Physics and Astronomy” course, almost from scratch. Since than, I have taught this class several times, at the undergraduate level to STEM majors, and at the graduate level to Physicists and Astronomers, and I have written the first draft of a textbook on the same subject. Here, I’d like to share some of the practices I have found to be useful and some of the challenges I have identified during this time."
b05bdb2300d6cf08f045fc4746857a3782b118dd,artificial intelligence competencies for data science undergraduate curricula,"In August 2017, the ACM Education Council initiated a task force to add to the broad, interdisciplinary conversation on data science, with an articulation of the role of computing discipline-specific contributions to this emerging field. Specifically, the task force is seeking to define what the computing contributions are to this new field, in order to provide guidance for computer science or similar departments offering data science programs of study at the undergraduate level. The ACM Data Science Task Force has completed the initial draft of a curricular report. The computing-knowledge areas identified in the report are drawn from across computing disciplines and include several sub-areas of AI. This short paper describes the overall project, highlights AI-relevant areas, and seeks to open a dialog about the AI competencies that are to be considered central to a data science undergraduate curriculum."
1499e67a1022b7d47e1ad24ac7650ae797769bf5,urban data science education a key actor towards improving datadriven policymaking for solving urban problems,"  
This paper explains the benefits of Urban Data Science Education in improving data driving policy-making and highlights the impact of vital use of available open data using a practical demonstration from the Summer-Winter School (SWS) at CEPT University Ahmedabad India.  Good Urban data policies can be an important driver for smart city research and the implementation of good data management practices. Many authors are also becoming interested in the data revolution that is enhancing the way we study and understand cities. It now becomes appropriate to respond to this need in an evidence-informed manner by working with stakeholders to encourage a more resilient approach via education for the younger enthusiast, leading to more transparent, improved, sustainable and safer urban cities. However, the major challenge we foresee is the inability to utilize the large amount of urban data generated daily. With the drive to mobilize more education towards urban data science and analytics, generated data can be effectively utilized to make informed and evidence-based decisions. This paper points to a practical methodology for reproducibility, the key steps taken, as it views the inclusion of an Urban Data Science curriculum as priceless, and a decision that will bring into notice the importance of engaging the younger generation in scholastic learning on data principles and analytics. Data along with spatial enhancement can be the driving factor towards improving data-driven policy-making for solving urban problems in smart cities.

These data sets are valuable assets and in great needs to be analyzed. However, there is a shortage of workforce for big data analysis. Education innovations are required to empower students with the skills and technologies for large dataset analysis. Over the last few years, there is a high demand for new programs in data science and analytics (DSA). We has performed a systematic study of the existing DSA programs in the US by checking the detailed information about the degree programs, the program competencies, the curriculum designs, the expected learning outcomes, program sizes, professional careers, and other related information.

To address this challenge, we propose Proj4X, a general project model that gives students the flexibility in choosing subject areas for the projects based on their background and interests, while requiring every project to address the key knowledge and skills covered in the course. Although project-based learning has been well researched, only a few studies have addressed the challenges in managing student-initiated projects. We have applied Proj4X to a graduate database course in our data science program. We used student peer evaluation to measure the performance of projects objectively and study the effect of group size on the performance of projects and the correlation between specific aspects of a project and its overall rating. Student feedback shows that Proj4X can greatly foster the collaboration among students of diverse backgrounds and inspire them to work on a wide range of interesting topics: from satellite tracker, hospital search during pandemic, to wildlife diversity monitoring."

Increasing the diversity of this workforce increases the social and economic possibilities for the individual as well as national economic status and global prominence in innovation and technology. The Curriculum and Community Enterprise for Restoration Science has created a nexus between STEM education and possible college and career pathways in data science through ecological experiences in the classroom and in the field. Focusing on data collection and interpretation, New York City students from underserved communities are exposed to the local marine environment and efforts to restore aquatic species as well as the water quality in New York Harbor. The use of an innovative and motivating curriculum for both students and teachers bolstered confidence in acquired skills and content. By introducing students to these heretofore untapped STEM areas of interest, the BOP CCERS + STEM C Project has created opportunities in college and career options for underrepresented populations and the possibility of growing a more diverse STEM workforce."

With the development of many mega-science astronomical projects, for example CTA, DESI, EUCLID, FAST, GAIA, JWST, LAMOST, LSST, SDSS, SKA, and large scale simulations, astronomy has become a Big Data science. Astronomical data is not only necessary resource for scientific research, but also very valuable resource for education and public outreach (EPO), especially in the era of Internet and Cloud Computing. IAU WG Data-driven Astronomy Education and Public Outreach is hosted at the IAU Division B (Facilities, Technologies and Data Science) Commission B2 (Data and Documentation), and organized jointly with Commission C1 (Astronomy Education and Development), Commission C2 (Communicating Astronomy with the Public), Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD), Office for Astronomy Outreach (OAO) and several other non IAU communities, including IVOA Education Interest Group, American Astronomical Society Worldwide Telescope Advisory Board, Zooniverse project and International Planetarium Society. The working group has the major objectives to: Act as a forum to discuss the value of astronomy data in EPO, the advantages and benefits of data driven EPO, and the challenges facing to data driven EPO; Provide guidelines, curriculum, data resources, tools, and e-infrastructure for data driven EPO; Provide best practices of data driven EPO. In the paper, backgrounds, current status and working plans in the future are introduced. More information about the WG is available at: this http URL"

This diverse network brings together biodiversity, data, and education specialists to identify core biodiversity data competencies for undergraduate students, develop strategies for integrating these competencies into the introductory biology curriculum, and build capacity for sustained development and implementation of biodiversity and data literacy education. Since the start of funding one year ago, BLUE Data has been working to review the current landscape of data literacy competencies from primary to graduate education in biodiversity data science, identify gaps in student learning related to data and biodiversity science core skills, and generate community consensus on defined biodiversity data literacy standards.
 At a recent BLUE Data workshop associated with the Emerging Innovations for Biodiversity Data conference in Berkeley, California, participants worked together to define competencies and identify strategies to facilitate broad-scale integration of transferrable data literacy skills and knowledge to improve undergraduate biology training and meet increasing workforce demands in both data and biodiversity sciences. This discussion also identified current efforts and explored existing resources in order to identify gaps that should be targeted in our efforts moving forward.
 In this presentation, we will introduce the SPNHC and TDWG communities to BLUE Data, and describe our vision and goals, partners, and educational modules. We will share results from our recent activities, including the outcomes of the Emerging Innovations for Biodiversity Data workshop. BLUE Data welcomes new partnerships with those also interested in defining the undergraduate biodiversity data literacy landscape and charting future efforts of this network."

These roles embrace elements of data stewardship, data management, data science and data visualization (Lyon & Takeda 2012). iSchools and Library Schools are introducing data curation into the curriculum, to prepare students for these roles. This paper presents a Case Study where an “immersive” approach to teaching research data management (RDM) constructs, is embedded within a Doctoral Seminar Program and an MLIS Special Topic at the University of Pittsburgh iSchool. 
The methodology builds on the initial immersive informatics pilot study, where a novel RDM training course was developed and delivered in a partnership with the University of Melbourne (Shadbolt et al, 2014). The immersive informatics concept is based on the placement of students within a research environment i.e. faculty science laboratory, during the course. The placement facilitates a bilateral exchange of RDM experience, questions and knowledge, between the LIS student and the practicing research scientist. 
The paper also provides reflections on the relevance of this education for future service development, within the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries."

The Information Systems (IS)/Information Technology (IT) educators have been facing the conundrum of whether an emerging technology is a ""game-changing"" development or something more transient so as to avoid ""bloating"" the curriculum. This study examines the body of knowledge as represented in our IT/IS program course syllabi and the recent job postings in five of our specialization areas including data science, computer science, healthcare IT, information systems and cybersecurity using natural language processing techniques. One of our goals is to identify the major overlaps and gaps between the two entities systematically by employing quantitative methods. The major contributions of this study lie in that it demonstrates how such data-driven analysis and mining approach informs clarifications to the wording of existing course syllabi, modifications to existing course contents, or the introduction of new courses into the curriculum. Lastly, the future research directions are delineated which this knowledge base can be applied to enhance university graduates' employability by analyzing students' resumes and presenting which jobs most closely match their knowledge, skills, and abilities."

It addresses upper secondary students and was realized by weekly sessions (three hours) over seven months. The whole course that is intended to introduce upper secondary school students to the field of data science consists of four modules. In module 1, the learners are introduced into the basics of statistics and big data and it aims at developing their data competence and data awareness. In the sec- ond module, learners are introduced to machine learning and programming based, among others, on examples from module 1. In the third and fourth module, learners can apply their knowledge gained in modules 1 and 2 and will work in small groups on real and meaningful data science projects. In this paper, we want to concentrate on the statistics components, especially of module 1, and we will present how we develop the data competence and data awareness of upper secondary school students to prepare them to work on data science projects in modules 3 and 4."
ba0ba66b6961d604c582a18516678656df74bcdb,taking a chance in the classroom teaching upperlevel undergraduate statistics through a sharedhybrid model,"31 At small liberal arts colleges like Vassar College, statistics courses attract a large and growing number of students across campus, yet course offerings are limited due to faculty size. With two statisticians on campus, Vassar offers sections of six courses each year: Introduction to Statistics (algebraand calculus-based), Probability, Applied Statistical Modeling (Stats II), Statistical Inference (classical), and Bayesian Statistics. These offerings stretch faculty resources as far as possible, but we were determined to establish a statistics major and provide a rich curriculum. To do so, we need more intermediate and advanced courses, but are constrained by faculty size and growing demand for current courses. This challenge is not unique to Vassar College. Almost everyone is trying to establish and grow their statistics curricula. Some small schools have already made progress in offering a statistics minor and/or major, or even data science courses. Further growth in demand for statistics and data science courses is projected. Statisticians are expected to eventually make up a third of the faculty in a mathematics and statistics department at a small liberal arts college offering courses in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and statistics, and statistics courses could constitute a third of the curriculum of such a department. Before we arrive at this world, how can we encourage and enable interested students to immerse themselves in more statistical thinking, analysis, and practice within the constraints of faculty size?"

This effort embraces all aspects of modeling: mathematical, statistical, computational, and data-based, as well as science-/physics-based. Indeed, for most interesting applications, these aspects interweave and no one sphere of expertise will have all the answers. We will use the term “modeling” as an umbrella for all of these. The emergence of data science—and data-enabled science—as a major area of research and study makes this blending of skills and understanding from the entire mathematical sciences spectrum critically important. When we say “mathematical sciences,” we include statistics, operations research, data science, and algorithmic approaches—pure, industrial, and applied mathematics. Certainly, modeling will be a key element of educational programs that prepare students for work in data-rich environments. Arguably, modeling is key to moving from data to information and making good decisions. Another major motivation for this article is the fact that applied mathematics and statistics share much of the raison d’être for K–12 education in the mathematical sciences in the first place.

To address this growth, higher education has identified the importance of cloud computing courses that deliver practical and hands-on material relevant to this rapidly evolving field. This is especially relevant as cloud services are quickly becoming the standard computing model for many new computational approaches, including advanced subjects such as machine learning and data science. Since cloud computing influences a number of other traditional computing subjects such as networking and data storage, the ability to incorporate specific components of cloud computing teaching content into a variety of courses has also become important. However, a lack of availability of high-quality teaching material that is easy to integrate, when teaching rapidly evolving cloud-related concepts, continues to be a challenge for instructors. As the volume of teaching material that educators and other providers are willing to share increases, it is important that the content is easily discoverable and accurately catalogued. Using appropriate Learning Objectives (LOs) and tags associated with the correct course material contributes toward a reliable and trustworthy source for faculty. This Working Group (WG) has addressed these challenges by 1) creating a canonical list of LOs, based on the LOs included in the Knowledge Areas (KAs) developed by the ITiCSE working groups in 2018 and 2019; 2) searching for existing teaching material, cataloging the material by LO and then combining the LOs into exemplar modules for some of the more common classes that adopt cloud computing; 3) creating sample syllabi for these exemplars following the ACM Computer Science Curricula 2013 approach; and 4) developing a solution for disseminating the materials and keeping them up to date."

This period was also when conceptual foundations emerged, thus changing the content (and names) of those initial courses. I am happy to see that many of the ideas for mathematics in computing education from that time remain relevant today, but I now want to turn to the future, or at least the "" near-term "" future. "" Data Science "" is one of those popular buzzwords in the near-term future for computing (and other disciplines). A quick Google search of the term "" data science "" yields about 48.2 million results. As we work in the range of petabytes (i.e., "" Big Data, "" another buzzword), many challenges arise that require engineering solutions to consider how to capture, hold, and process this much data in a reasonable amount of time. And yes, there is a substantial mathematical component to resolving these engineering issues that I may discuss in a future MathCounts column, but for now I will focus on an overview of the mathematics, primarily statistics, needed in the curriculum to interpret this volume of data, and rate of acquisition, as realized in data science. The title of this present column is loosely based on, but more positively toned than, the famous one attributed to Benjamin Disraeli and used frequently by Mark Twain: "" Lies, damned lies and statistics. "" Statistics and data science can be used to lead us to new realizations (and to mislead if not interpreted properly or honestly). I am optimistic , and want to look at how computing and mathematics education can support students as they prepare for careers in data science. But before I can look into this preparation, I need to explore the defini-tion(s) of data science and how mathematics and computing connect. I have not yet taught a bona fide data science course, but did offer a new introductory course that used simple data science inspired projects to introduce concepts in CS1 and CS2. What exactly is this field of data science? I sense the definition continues to evolve, but I will present a few descriptions now. Almost twenty years ago, C.F.

Despite its importance, there is almost no dedicated course for programming in the traditional chemical engineering curriculum in many universities. In this article, a future chemical engineering curriculum that includes a programming course is discussed and its integration into traditional courses is also proposed. This study proposes to use three software i.e., Microsoft Excel, GAMS, and Python to make students comfortable to programming so they can learn further by themselves. A representative case of classic logistics problem is presented as a case study. It is expected that this teaching strategy and the proposed example will improve students’ cognition in programming."

Big Data paradigm has revolutionized the entire IT landscape and changed all and every facet of human culture and behavior. Nowadays we have many new technologies, methods and tools to manage and process efficiently the large data volumes available. As a result of the information age, Data Science has emerged as a new inter-multi and even transdisciplinary area of knowledge. The Data Scientist is “a unicorn” facing the complexity of Big Data challenges, responsible for integrated diverse aspects of data management from data capturing to uncovering patterns and insights hidden in huge volumes of heterogeneous data to drive decision-making. A Data Scientist is a professional with analytic skills, abilities in bringing disparate areas together in a creative way, asking the right questions driven by solving problems, curious, creative and IT savvy. In our previous studies, we identified analytical thinking and analytical skills as the core competences of data analysts and researchers. This study addresses Data Science and the Data Scientist’s skills from the point of view of designing a curriculum for developing competences for successful career in the area of Data Science. We are sharing the results of an empirical study conducted to assess the entry competences of students, potential candidates for a Data Science MA Program. The survey emphasizes abilities rather than knowledge, stressing on analytical, critical thinking of current students in BA programs. The constructed questionnaire is based on known tests to assess analytical thinking, critical thinking, problem solving attitude, etc. adapted to the objectives of designing a Data Science curriculum. It represents logical problems in three different formats: math questions, text assignment and figures pattern recognition. The questionnaire also includes self-assessment of analytical thinking skills and dispositions. The survey was done in the Fall 2018. About 250 BSc students in their senior year were approached by an on-line or paper questionnaire. Students were originally classified in two categories according to their majors as “technical” or “non-technical”. Statistical data analysis was conducted by using SPSS. Our analysis reveals the level of analytical, creative and critical thinking of the respondents. The assumptions that both categories of potential students have similar potential for success in studying at the Data Science Master program and to become successful Data Scientists was justified."

First, we explore the literature on service learning, traditionally the primary type of experiential learning in LIS. We define and provide historical context and scrutinize service learning’s benefits and challenges for students, faculty, LIS programs, and parent institutions. Second, we trace the evolution of experiential learning from service learning to community-based learning (CBL); we underline the ways in which such an approach in its epistemology and its practice transcends the traditional service-learning model. Finally, we unpack the novel ways in which one iSchool’s LIS program is implementing community-based learning, namely by embracing data science and design thinking in its pedagogical approach to a new three-course, twelve-credit post-Bachelor’s certificate (PBC). We discuss the institutional context for the certificate, the project partners, the 12 PBC Fellows, and the curriculum, which includes three new courses (Design Thinking for Digital Community Service, Data Analytics for Community-Based Data and Service, and a capstone)."

Bitcoin, the original application motivated development of Blockchain technology, aimed removing banks as the mediators and trusted third party in financial transactions. But the scope of this underlying technology is much broader than purely the word of cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology offers new paradigm of connectivity, information exchange and information use, exploring decentralized, distributed data processing, and encrypting via public and private keys. Blockchain was launched as the underlying technology in introducing bitcoins. Research conducted on the dynamics of publications addressing Blockchain, shows that this technology deserted recently from purely bitcoin / crypto-currencies application domain. The intensity of publication addressing applications of this technology demonstrated its relevance to different business domains, mostly Internet of Things (IoT), but also sectors as Energy, Healthcare, and Finance, mostly related to retailed services. Consideration of Blockchain technology from this broader perspective, justify the needs of introducing it to students in fields like Computer Science, Information Systems, and Information Technology, but it is especially valuable for programs training Data Science competences. The paper shares experience of introducing Blockchain technology, which is still in its infantry stage according to maturity life cycle, in Data Science Master Program. Resolving problems like lack of sufficient well-developed training materials, lack of competent trainers, and lack of adequate equipment to experiment are among the overcome major barriers. Dynamics of innovations in area of information technologies and shortening the life cycle from discovery to wide distribution forces education institutions, traditionally conservative in adopting innovation, to develop experience in fast adjustment of their curriculum to react to the emerging challenges. The case of incorporated Blockchain related content into curriculum is discussed as a possible practice."
7926c1bebdcdee144554a6de4ac01d1c9e09b60a,training graduate students to teach statistics and data science from a distance,"Enrollment in undergraduate statistics and data science courses has rapidly increased in just the last decade, resulting in an increased reliance on graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) and graduate instructors of record (GRIs). In the age of the COVID-19 pandemic, teaching from a distance has become a necessity. Many instructors, including GTAs and GRIs, need to adapt to new technologies and reconsider pedagogical decisions. This paper presents our experiences from a graduate teaching fellowship program created because of the pandemic. The program had two major components: 1) pedagogical workshops attended by teaching fellows from multiple disciplines across the university and 2) one-on-one mentoring by a faculty member from the fellow’s primary discipline. Here, we provide a unique look at graduate training from both the perspective of the mentor and the mentee. We share a sample training curriculum and propose recommendations for those interested in implementing teaching training opportunities for graduate students."

Recently, a new machine learning program have been integrated into the Israeli high school computer science curriculum and thus we added a new machine learning module to the Methods of Teaching Computer Science (MTCS) course, which is part of the teachers' preparation program. This machine learning module provides us a unique opportunity to teach both pedagogy and content with the same subject matter. After teaching the basics of machine learning, we asked the students to find similarities between human learning theories and machine learning algorithms. Students identified several interesting parallels: (a) Supervised learning is similar to behavioral learning as the machine learns to connect training examples (stimuli) with labels (behavior). Also, the learning is based on minimizing error (punishment) function, (b) Reinforcement learning is similar to behavioral learning as learning is based on feedback from the environment, (c) Constructivism can be identified in the iterative convergence of the algorithm; the inner model improves each iteration based on the current knowledge, and (d) Social learning is reflected in clustering as each cluster affects the learning of the other clusters. In our talk, we present the idea that computational mental models may be used to reinforce pedagogical mental models and vice versa."

0bf73ebf496b0c0b63e725df7bce9ef701bd63f8,early undergraduate biostatistics data science introduction using r r studio the tidyverse,"Abstract Increasingly, students training in the biological sciences depend on a proper grounding in biological statistics, data science and experimental design. As biological datasets increase in size and complexity, transparent data management and analytical methods are essential skills for undergraduate biologists. We propose that using the software R and RStudio are effective tools to train first- and second-year undergraduate students in data visualization and foundational statistical analyses. Here, we present the redesigned laboratory curriculum for our Experimental Design and Statistics course, a required course for all first- or second-year biology majors at Lawrence University, a small liberal arts institution in northeast Wisconsin. We include an example 10-week syllabus and eight laboratory exercises (as supplementary materials) for undergraduate institutions that aim to introduce and guide students through acquiring a basic understanding of biostatistical analyses and skills using R and RStudio. We also provide a flexible framework and examples that are easily modifiable and cover the essential biostatistics and data science skills needed for biology undergraduates. Finally, we discuss the potential pitfalls and obstacles as well as the intrinsic benefits and expected outcomes of our laboratories."
456f586b7371a1ead103048fc6e14d156c578143,critical reviews of selected postgraduate programs in transportation engineering against the needs of infrastructure development,"In this research critical reviews of selected outcome based postgraduate programs in Transportation Engineering (M.E/M.Tech.) are presented which are offered by a set of selected leading engineering colleges/institutions in India.Macro and micro analysis of the courses have been performed. Most of the postgraduate programs offer specialization in transportation engineering design, or transportation system engineering,or transportation engineering management. It is observed that there is a need for greater focus on the Transportation System Analysis (Performance and Optimization), Economic Analysis, and Planning Methods (Data Sciences for Transportation), Intelligent Transportation System, Safety and Security, Transportation Policy, Planning and Sustainability and Urban Transportation. In the fast, most of the graduate students took up teaching jobs. Due to rapid economic development, they may end up in the corporate sector. It is learnt that only Indian Railways offers professional development programs for their engineers. Rarely transportation engineering departments depute their engineers to postgraduate programs. Considering the massive expansion of infrastructure development, it is suggested that more specialization is needed on Policy Analysis, Urban Transportation, Performance and Optimization, Analysis and Planning Methods, Data Sciences for Transportation, Intelligent Transportation, Safety and Security, and Sustainability. The existing programs could be improved based on the needs analysis.Also, there is need to focus on the consultancy works so that these postgraduate engineers can establish consultancy units. The curriculum need to be continuously be updated to meet the needs of massive infrastructure needs."

These requirements cover six core courses, a leadership or project management course, two required courses corresponding to a declared specialization, two electives, and a capstone project or thesis. A specialization may be declared as part of the application process or may be declared at any time during a student’s tenure in the program. Students also have the option of choosing a general data science curriculum with no declared specialization. There are four specializations: Analytics and Modeling (https://catalogs.northwestern.edu/sps/graduate/data-science/datascience-ms-analytics-modeling-specialization/), Analytics Management (https://catalogs.northwestern.edu/sps/graduate/data-science/datascience-ms-analytics-management-specialization/), Artificial Intelligence (https://catalogs.northwestern.edu/sps/graduate/data-science/datascience-ms-artificial-intelligence-specialization/), and Data Engineering (https://catalogs.northwestern.edu/sps/graduate/data-science/datascience-ms-data-engineering-specialization/).

The workshop focused on the application of the Darwin Core data standard (Wieczorek et al. 2012) to extant data and the subsequent publication of data to the open access data infrastructures provided by OBIS and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The curriculum for this workshop was modeled using The Carpentries evidence-based best practices of teaching. The materials and website are openly available via GitHub and are free for re-use or adaptation under an MIT license. Some unconventional features of the workshop included:
 
 
 
 Much of the workshop time was allocated to breakout rooms and individual work.
 
 
 The use of concurrent, topical breakout rooms led by instructors in combination with “floating” specialist volunteers.
 
 
 A 100% open and free virtual workshop leveraging synchronous and asynchronous communications technologies including Slack, Zoom, and GitHub.
 
 
 All instructional steps were offered in both Python and R (dual-programming language materials).

366f17a1258f0ad64ecde518c39516f796db8eca,how could we teach data science in primary school,"In this paper, we propose that informal aspects of data science could be introduced in primary school. The International Data Science in Schools Project (IDSSP) framework for data science curriculum provides a guide for a data science curriculum aimed at upper secondary level. We analyzed synergies between the IDSSP framework and the current content of the Australian Curriculum at the primary school level (ages 5‐11) for Mathematics, Digital Technologies, and two General Capabilities (ICT, Critical and Creative Thinking). Our findings suggest that the primary curriculum already exists to support informal, age‐appropriate data science content for young children. A vignette of a Year 4 (age 9) class is used to illustrate what such a curriculum could look like in practice."

There is not one simple answer, but there are many complex answers. Data Science, and data analytics, are new and nebulas, and takes on different characteristics depending on: The subject matter being analyzed, the maturity of the research, and whether the employed subject specific analytics is descriptive, diagnostic, discoveritive, predictive, or prescriptive, in nature. In addition, in a, thus far, business driven paradigm shift, university curriculums teaching data analytics pertaining to Earth science have, as a whole, lagged behind, andor have varied in approach.This presentation attempts to breakdown and identify the many activities that Earth Data Scientists, as a profession, encounter, as well as provide case studies of specific Earth Data Scientist and data analytics efforts. I will also address the educational preparation, that best equips future Earth Data Scientists, needed to further Earth science heterogeneous data research and applications analysis. The goal of this presentation is to describe the actual need for Earth Data Scientists and the practical skills to perform Earth science data analytics, thus hoping to initiate discussion addressing a baseline set of needed expertise for educating future Earth Data Scientists."
1cc664b64340548e15dc7f031eca04334b078105,the intersection of literacy and digital literacy incorporating writing standards with computer technology standards,"This project aims to increase access to computer science/computer technology education by providing teachers resources to enable them to teach computer science/computer technology. A survey was taken to discover the interests and needs of teachers in Hamilton County, Tennessee. The project resulted in the creation of several lesson plans that integrate English and computer science through hands-on web development exercises, computational thinking opportunities, and critical thinking. Introduction There is a lot of pressure on schools and parents to fully prepare children for their futures. Not only does society expect students to be well grounded in foundational skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic, but they also hope students will hone technical skills and explore careerspecific knowledge before graduation. This hope for technically trained individuals is visible in the rapidly growing workforce demand for computing professionals. From 2014-2024, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts an increase of 12.5 percent, which is almost double the predicted growth for employment overall during that time [17]. Unfortunately, many schools do not have the capacity, the teachers, or the budget to provide any form of computer technology class. In the state of Tennessee, only half of the schools provide opportunities to learn computer skills and concepts [3]. Of the schools unable to provide computer technology classes in Tennessee, 69% of them say that most of their time is devoted to courses that are related to testing requirements [3]. Research Question The primary question guiding our research was: “what resources could be created to help noncomputer technology teachers teach computer technology?” The goal is to understand what resources teachers need to help increase access to computer technology / computer science education. Related Work Attempts at interdisciplinary computer science classes have been executed at schools and universities. For example, Union College added various themes to their introductory classes to illustrate the versatility of computer science [18]. Other university projects extended beyond the computer science curriculum. At the UC Berkeley School of Information, they included data science principles in a social studies class to bolster inquiry-based learning exercises [13]. Similarly, the University of Georgia integrated technical skills and data science principles into one of their journalism classes [1]. Another project brought the technology to a senior-level literature class on Gothic Novels [6]. Research has also been conducted on the viability of introducing interdisciplinary computer science classes into K-12 schools. In 2014, a group of academics from North Carolina State University and Meredith College piloted a Big Data program for middle schoolers. During the creation of their curriculum, they found parallels between principles in computer science and common core standards in mathematics [10]."
ff04f80aa54d7ea30eefc1384c7b58b7795c578d,advances in aeronautical informatics technologies towards flight ,"The history of flight started with the pioneer era. The introduction of mechanical controls (including hydraulics) then led to the second era. Later, with the utilization of computers and automation in aircraft, we reached the third era. Now, we are moving towards the fourth era of flight, namely Flight 4.0, which is characterized by “smart” and “connected” aircraft that extensively exploit emerging information and communication technologies. 
Aeronautical informatics is advancing rapidly through the synergy between information and communication technologies and aeronautics. Multi-core avionic platforms, wireless avionics networking, service-oriented architectures and IoT, data sciences and semantic infrastructures are shaping systems to come. Increasing autonomy requirements are challenging the community to investigate new ways to assure safety. Modern software engineering methodologies and real-time software techniques are altering the established development practice. Universities are starting to align their aerospace engineering and computer science curriculums in order to address this synergy. 
This book is a unique compilation of advancements in aeronautical informatics, introducing the changing technology landscape of flight with respect to a new push in information and communication technology."
6b3df1d0db9323076034387179bb785be150e87f,computings social obligation,"The cover of the August issue of Communications of the ACM showcases Harvard's impressive experiment integrating ethics throughout its undergraduate computer science curriculum [6]. Anyone currently grappling with exploding enrollments must applaud Harvard's deliberate use of resources to broaden CS education beyond its traditional technical components. In a similar vein, ACM recently updated its professional code of ethics, calling on CS professionals to acknowledge ""all people are stakeholders"" and to ""ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work,"" [1] possibly adding to the pressure many in CS education may be feeling to 'up their game' when it comes to their programs' attention to ethics. Unsurprisingly, doing ethics in CS can seem like yet another requirement tasked to an already overburdened system. If one is operating under constraints, perhaps limited by shortages in money and personnel, ethics, or put another way, instilling concern for computing's impact on society, starts to seem like a luxury: something that we all agree is valuable and that would be nice to have if we can afford it. But, what happens if learning about ethics is just as fundamental to software engineering as procedural abstraction or just as crucial to data science as learning to avoid spurious correlation?"
15a2eef702fb97ac2cbab9a4f1780745c3bd8d8e,keeping curriculum relevant identifying longitudinal shifts in computer science topics through analysis of qa communities,"Keeping up with new knowledge being produced in computing related domains is a difficult task given the pace of change in the field. Specifically, in domains that are undergoing a lot of innovation, such as Data Science or Artificial Intelligence, updating curricula is not easy. Yet, there is a need to be cognizant of new topics in order to create and update curricula and keep it relevant. In this paper we present an innovative approach to help educators keep a better track of changes in a domain and be able to map their curricula objectives to emerging topics and technologies. We leverage Q&A sites, Reddit and StackExchange, which provide a useful online platform for sharing of information and thereby generate a valuable corpus of knowledge. We use Data Science as a case study for our work and through a longitudinal analysis of these sites we identify popular topics and how they have changed over time. We believe innovations such as these are essential for improving computer science education and for bridging the workplace-school divide in teaching of newer topics. Our unique and innovative approach can be applied to other CS topics as well."
01fecc699976574142fd108a763fa7d6ad957187,the growing opportunity of clinical data management in ukraine,"Many specialized positions, even entry-level, in the pharmaceutical industry require training above and beyond standard University degree programs. A shortage of specialized clinical data managers in Ukraine means private sector companies are developing internal resource training programs to deepen their pool of available candidates. Given the strong medical education system and established IT outsourcing industry, we believed developing a pool of talented clinical data managers within Ukraine was a feasible goal.The IT outsourcing industry is the second largest export service industry in Ukraine, and one of the main sectors in the economy. More than 50% of Ukraine's IT services revenue came from the United States, the rest mostly from the EU.[1] Ukraine has built a workforce adapted to IT outsourcing, but the lack of local professionals in the fields of clinical data management and clinical data science hinders similar growth in the clinical research sector. Ukraine has a well-established medical education system that trains its healthcare professionals in accordance with EU regulations. Hospitals are predominantly state-owned; the private medical sector is almost nonexistent. The academic and non-profit clinical research sectors are small in comparison to Western European countries, and opportunities for careers within them limited. This leads to a 'brain drain' of medical professionals from Ukraine to other countries in search of higher wages and professional advancement. With its strong education system and highly educated medical workforce, Ukraine is an attractive but under-utilised location for clinical studies. [2] There are approximately 30 clinical research sites in Ukraine handling preclinical through Phase IV studies. In December 2020 on clinicaltrials.gov there were 557 active or recruiting clinical trials listed taking place in Ukraine. Regulatory hurdles and approval timelines have greatly improved in recent years.Currently, when CROs wish to hire data managers to assist with local clinical trials in Ukraine, they have to hire non-specialists who must teach themselves on the job. At present there are no university courses or formal training programs within the country for clinical data managers.Following the success of the Clinical Statistical Programming training program developed by our team and offered since 2013 in partnership V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University,[3] we recently launched an in-house clinical data management training program in partnership between leading Biometrics CROs Cytel and Intego Group. Upon program completion, students have the opportunity to transition into full-time employment. Ours is the first centralized training program for clinical data managers in the country. We already started a conversation with some of the country's leading universities to help them develop a formal educational program in clinical data management. Our internal training program will serve as a pilot and a proof of concept. We expect that many elements, such as curriculum, admission requirements, quality control, internships, etc., will successfully scale up in an academic environment. Our paper will discuss opportunities for the clinical data management sector in Ukraine, the challenges of recruiting data managers from the existing healthcare workforce, the region’s unique strengths, laws and regulations. We also discuss specifics of the internal training program, development of a course syllabus, and transitioning students from coursework into hands-on data management training.Article length: 8 pages.

7f743894f041d4272b6fb4b6341cd59bab9287ca,data modeling for undergraduate data science abstract only,"Widespread interest in developing and enhancing undergraduate data science education is evidenced by the interim report Envisioning the Data Science Discipline: The Undergraduate Perspective recently released by the National Academies of Science/Engineering/Medicine. The report identifies data modeling as one of the key concepts for developing and applying data acumen (making good decisions and judgements with data). We define data modeling as a process for documenting how data is connected, processed, and stored; a particular data model may address one or more of these aspects. This BoF session is proposed to focus specifically on data modeling skills for data science study. Traditional data models taught in computing curriculum include Entity-Relationship, UML, and relational models; these topics can be covered at various points in the curriculum, but are typically included in database courses. The proliferation of advanced data models and systems (for example, but not limited to, document stores, graph databases, column stores, key-value stores, and relational + map reduce) provides an opportunity for developing/enhancing database curriculum at the undergraduate level to support programs in data science. A goal of this BoF is to identify faculty who wish to develop and share best practices for teaching data modeling for data science, including course learning objectives and outcomes, techniques, and materials."

13c9c48f9647787cce124f62c639dbeba7563d55,cloud computing developing contemporary computer science curriculum for a cloudfirst future,"Cloud Computing has gained significant momentum in the last five years and is regarded as a paradigm shift away from traditional 'silo' based computing. It is no longer seen as a niche area of technology, offering a diverse range of scalable and redundant service deployment models, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS). These models are applied to areas such as IoT, Cyber-Physical Systems, Social Media, Data Science, Media Streaming, Ecommerce, and Health Informatics. The growth in cloud presents challenges for companies to source expertise that securely supports their business when migrating/deploying services to the Cloud - particularly Small-Medium-Enterprises (SME) with limited resources. The UK Government recently published the Digital Skills Crisis report, identifying skill-set challenges facing industry, with a shortage in cloud skills negatively impacting business. While cloud technologies have evolved at significant pace, the development of contemporary Computer Science curriculum in the further and higher education (HE) sector has lagged behind. The challenges faced in the sector includes the training of educators, institutional gaps (software and hardware policies), regulatory constraints, and access to cloud platforms. Collectively these challenges are significant, but not insurmountable. By embedding fundamental cloud skills throughout the educator and student journey, both stakeholders will be better positioned to understand and practically apply the use of appropriate cloud services, and produce graduates that can support the needs of industry. This working group (WG) aims to: i) assess current cloud computing curricula in CS and similar programs, ii) document industry needs for in-demand cloud skills, iii) identify issues and gaps around cloud curriculum uptake, and iv) develop solutions to meet the skill demands on core Cloud Computing topics, technical skills exercises, and modules for integration with contemporary Computer Science curricula."

These core skills may revolutionize progress in areas such as health care and precision medicine, autonomous systems and robotics, and neuroscience. Skills in data science and artificial intelligence are in high demand in industrial research and development, but we do not believe that traditional recruiting and training models in industry (e.g., internships, continuing education) are serving the needs of the diverse populations of students who will be required to revolutionize these fields. Our program, the Cohort-based Integrated Research Community for Undergraduate Innovation and Trailblazing (CIRCUIT), targets trailblazing, high-achieving students who face barriers in achieving their goals and becoming leaders in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence research. Traditional recruitment practices often miss these ambitious and talented students from nontraditional backgrounds, and these students are at a higher risk of not persisting in research careers. In the CIRCUIT program we recruit holistically, selecting students on the basis of their commitment, potential, and need. We designed a training and support model for our internship. This model consists of a compressed data science and machine learning curriculum, a series of professional development training workshops, and a team-based robotics challenge. These activities develop the skills these trailblazing students will need to contribute to the dynamic, team-based engineering teams of the future."

An equally important aim is to educate children and young people to become data citizens who are aware of the current uses of data in society, able to use data to make decisions in their lives, and are actively engaged in critiquing the societal implications of future uses of data. The paper will explore the meanings of data citizenship, in light of the findings of a consultation with 96 children and young people (aged between 10 and 16 years old), from 11 schools in South East Scotland and the wider conceptual debates on citizenship and children and young people’s rights to privacy, participation, and education."

More than ever, teachers are applying technology to problem solving and decision making, and new methods for evaluation are replacing traditional rote learning and assessment. The new methods, however, are also producing vast amounts of data that need to be understood and applied effectively – a task falling, increasingly, to the school librarian because he or she is already familiar with cataloguing and retrieving information. Because of the need to manage information on a different scale, the proposed poster illustrates how we should teach data usage to school librarians. Currently, there are five categories of data science courses that iSchools teach (Si, Zhuang, Xing and Guo, 2013): (1) research methods, (2) data science, data management, and data service, (3) data statistics and analysis, (4) data warehouse, and (5) information studies and technologies. The proposed poster will summarize these areas, perhaps as follows:  Research method courses provide school librarians with the skill-set needed for developing courses, analyzing library user-needs, and for data collection.  Data science, data management, and data service courses teach librarians how to manage the data sets that teachers use for teaching assignments.  Data statistics and analysis courses help teachers and librarians to evaluate student records, analyze individual learning styles, and match student abilities with future majors.  Data warehouse knowledge covers the storage and retrieval of new storage media, traditional information systems, and document management.  Information studies and technology skills will promote health and financial informatics. Although data science is still at an early stage of adoption by most school boards, the author hopes that the poster stimulates an interest in its application in K-12 schools."

As a result the need for data scientists with the correct skill set to analyze and interpret the data has escalated. Not surprisingly, data scientists are currently one of the most wanted professions. Tertiary institutions are faced with the challenge of producing students with the correct blend of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. In an attempt to provide current post-graduate students with these skills, a flipped class room approach was adopted to teach students data warehousing as part of the data science curriculum. This paper used the four pillars of F-L-I-P (FLN 2014) to analyze data obtained from lecturer implementation experience and student course evaluation forms. It was shown that great strides have been made in this course in the adoption of the flipped class room although there is room for improvement in order to achieve flipped learning. The outcome of the study directly contributes to the improvement of subsequent implementations of the module."
59ea5057893da099a75d5aa09d0702fa888eb4a5,the gap between statistics education and statistical practice,"As I write this response to George Cobb’s call to rebuild the statistics curriculum, I am returning from a symposium, “Statistics in the 21st Century,” aimed at helping to define goals of a new center for statistics at MIT (which has been an outlier among premier U.S. universities in not having a statistics department). To me, the most striking aspect of the symposium was the consistency among its speakers in their admiration for the discipline of statistics, which focuses on the foundation of science and engineering: the use of data to provide information about the world. Maintaining this foundation as technology advances is a noble endeavor and, in the past few years, partly due to the advent of Data Science and Big Data, the importance of statistics has become much more widely appreciated. The teaching of statistics has evolved more slowly than statistical practice. In diagnosing the problem with undergraduate statistics education, Cobb returns to Leo Breiman’s “two cultures” article and makes some important points. I completely agree with him when, consistently with Breiman’s earlier sentiment, Cobb warns against ceding to others “all methods of analysis that do not rely on a probability model.” Tukey’s profoundly important emphasis on the distinction between exploratory and confirmatory (inferential) methods, including the corruption of operating characteristics due to exploratory preprocessing, remains central to modern statistics. Furthermore, Cobb rightly suggests that computation should play a big role throughout the curriculum. In Brown and Kass (2009, BK or we may concede that a particular method might possibly be a good one, but the authors have done nothing to indicate that it performs well. In specific settings, we often come to the opinion that the science would advance more quickly if the problems were formulated differently, formulated in a manner more familiar to trained statisticians.” We asked ourselves, What is it that differentiates expert statisti-"

However, despite its importance, there has been little work on understanding student internship experiences. To address this knowledge gap, we have conducted a study to find out how the current curriculum has prepared students for their internships, what are the major challenges students have faced in their internships, and how to enhance the curriculum to better prepare students for their internships and jobs. In this paper, we report findings of our study and discuss strategies for improving the curriculum based on student experiences and feedback. Our study provides key insights on student learning experiences that may benefit other data science programs. Our work also constitutes an important step towards establishing a feedback loop that couples internships and jobs with the curriculum, and continuously adapts the curriculum to the fast-evolving techniques and tools used in data science applications."

Research into the teaching of linear algebra continues to provide new insight into better ways of sharing linear algebraic knowledge and ways of thinking with students. Technology has become accessible and affordable for most students, and as such, should be used as an asset in teaching and learning. Modern applications have grown and can motivate learning and insights into the workings of linear algebraic ideas. Hence, the teaching of linear algebra has become increasingly important in this quantitatively driven world. In 1993, Carlson, Johnson, Lay, and Porter [1] initiated the first Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group (LACSG) to examine the role of the first course in linear algebra in the mathematics curriculum and offered numerous recommendations intended to better meet the needs of students and client disciplines at that time. The recommendations in [1] were a major step in raising awareness and significantly impacted linear algebra education both nationally and internationally. For example, special sessions on the learning and teaching of linear algebra were added to the programs of national and international meetings (e.g., the Joint Mathematics Meetings, International Linear Algebra Society meetings), and several important introductory linear algebra textbooks adopted the LACSG recommendations (e.g., [2]).

3e13eca3f26f568b24385c2e04f772bd4855222e,why computer science should be a core component of the medical curriculum,"In this paper, we argue for the incorporation of computer science skills into the medical curriculum. We are medical students in the United Kingdom (UK) and believe that such an addition would better equip us to be competent clinicians in an age of medical technological advancement. Teaching computer coding comprises both theoretical and practical approaches.1The former allows the learner to appreciate the computational mindset, which breaks down complex problems into smaller simpler constituents, whilst the latter teaches the programming skills that allows these problems to be solved. In our opinion, utilising programming to apply this computational mindset may pave the way for the conception of innovative applications in the medical field. The future physician will likely increasingly interact with information systems over time. To reflect this changing landscape, information technology (IT) is being incorporated into the curricula of many medical schools, in the form of modules such as medical data sciences.2 Although these modules can give us an insight into the value of technology as a tool for future clinical practice, they tend to fail to equip us with either the mentality or the means to capitalise on its utility. We feel such omissions highlight that we are being taught to keep pace with the latest developments rather than to be at the forefront of innovation ourselves."

Many universities begin to embrace the trends and propose several innovations and refinements in education, including teaching improvement, integrated curriculum, multidisciplinary programs, and capstone courses to better incubate students for future. In this paper, the experience of curriculum design and implementation for data science courses to the undergraduate program in mathematics is introduced. Based on the original focus on mathematical and computation theories, the employment of data science courses can provide students with the comprehensive theoretical and practical knowledge and skills for the challenges and industrial requirements nowadays. In addition, the curriculum is designed and implemented from the perspectives of students who major in applied mathematics (non-CS students) to better stimulate the learning, participation, exercise, and innovation. Major findings and lessons learned from the refined courses are discussed for more insight into the following deployment and refinement of the curriculum."

To keep up with this demand, attracting students early on to data science as well as providing them a solid foray into the field becomes increasingly important. We present a case study of an introductory undergraduate course in data science that is designed to address these needs. Offered at Duke University, this course has no prerequisites and serves a wide audience of aspiring statistics and data science majors as well as humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences students. We discuss the unique set of challenges posed by offering such a course, and in light of these challenges, we present a detailed discussion into the pedagogical design elements, content, structure, computational infrastructure, and the assessment methodology of the course. We also offer a repository containing all teaching materials that are open-source, along with supplementary materials and the R code for reproducing the figures found in the article."

An IDC Whitepaper states that IT departments must develop these new skills now that can allow them to scale at the speed of business while maintaining an infrastructure and architecture that is predictable, repeatable, and reliable. What is also needed is having the appropriate training and education that will enable IT departments to be more agile and more prepared to respond to business needs. Many corporate IT departments look to colleges and universities as part of the solution. Are students being prepared for these new roles? Findings from research show that data storage, cloud technologies and Big Data should be taught, but there are prohibiting factors for including these topics in a curriculum. The EMC Academic Alliance program was started in 2006 with the goal of partnering with universities to teach “open” courses, meaning the courses are technology oriented and not vendor specific. Today, the program has expanded so universities can offer courses in Information Storage & Management, Cloud Infrastructure & Services, and Data Science & Big Data Analytics. East Carolina University is building a curriculum using the courses and preparing students for new jobs in these technologies."

Among the pressing concerns at the forefront of this pandemic are the best models and practices for e-learning at speed and within budget for areas of the sector moving to blended learning. A diverse range of responses has been observed from rapid curriculum redevelopment to upskilling teachers in designing and offering e-learning. Amongst the many challenges, teachers find themselves using teaching methods they have never used before, from synchronous lectures to sharing material and lecture recording, there is a lack of access to online tools and technology, a concern about a diminished quality of learning due to the sudden shift to e-learning, and a threat to students’ well-being, achievement, and future prospects. Yet, the unexpected shift to e-learning became a unique opportunity for rethinking education and promoting innovation, through for example, the design of flexible teaching and learning programmes, a skill-focused curriculum in which problem solving, critical thinking and reflection are prominent, and the use of effective and evidence-based pedagogical approaches. The following papers were selected for this special issue and address concerns associated with blended learning, which also includes the use of Hyflex, together with students declaring that they were not convinced that their courses were suitable for online delivery. Reflecting on these papers, together with a suite of other challenges faced by the higher education community, presents an opportunity to consider the new skill sets that will be required and which theoretical frameworks will drive the forthcoming research agenda. The first article in this issue is a case study by Pierpaolo Vittorini and Alessandra Galassi entitled ‘From blended to online due to the COVID outbreak: the case study of a data science course’. This study compared the findings from cohorts of students from ‘the Nursing Sciences’ and the Prevention Sciences studying a data science course in a fully online course due to the COVID-19 pandemic with a previous presentation with identical groups of students where a blended pedagogical approach had been adopted. The most surprising finding from the feedback of students following the online course was that the ‘didactic quality’ had improved compared to those who studied with the blended learning presentation of the course. One reason suggested for this difference was the availability of on-demand video recorded lectures. These can be viewed repeatedly and especially during revision periods. However, difficulties were experienced when monitoring students with the chosen online proctoring system and some students reported problems with an increased workload.

They also provide specific suggestions about additional ways to create more opportunities for scaffolding and practice of qualitative thinking in our courses and curriculum. I commend them for this guidance—which is wholly consistent with the sentiments of many—including Brown & Kass (2009), the INGEnIOuS project, http://www.ingeniousmathstat.org and Cobb (2015). All suggest a broad definition of statistics, encourage efforts to ensure that statistics is a vibrant choice for students and call for major (radical?) changes to our curriculum to support this shift. While there have been major efforts in recent years to adapt our curriculum to provide exposure to the excitement of statistics [see for example several of the rich datasets in Gould, (2010)], students need to be more directly engaged with a broad range of new data-related topics to be successful in our increasingly diverse discipline (Horton, 2016; Ridgway, 2015). The growth of data science poses many challenges and opportunities. As the authors describe, to be relevant in this world awash in data, statistics students need exposure to quantitative and qualitative approaches for the planning and design of studies, conduct and analysis, as well as interpretation and communication of results and implications. I will briefly consider the implications of this paper as well as barriers for implementation of the approaches enunciated in this paper in two distinct areas: (1) our introductory courses as well as (2) our undergraduate programs in statistics."

In 1993, the Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group (LACSG [4]) published recommendations for a first course in linear algebra – emphasizing the importance of serving client disciplines and decreasing emphasis on abstraction by focusing on matrices, with a recommended core set of topics consisting of: operations on matrices, linear systems, determinants, properties of Rn, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and orthogonality. Recently, the National Science Foundation provided financial support to convene LACSG 2.0, bringing together experts on the teaching and learning of linear algebra along with representatives from client disciplines. Their forthcoming recommendations additionally emphasize the importance of linear maps, their compositions and inverses, as well as diagonalization and the singular value decomposition [12]. Topics recommended for a second course by this group include an abstract treatment of vector spaces, matrix factorizations, inner product spaces, finite-dimensional spectral theorem, pseudo-inverses, operators, and Jordan form. The teaching of linear algebra, we note, has received considerable attention as a topic of research [7, 14]. We complement the above body of work with two useful perspectives. First, our survey, which gathers data on topic coverage and client populations, situates the above recommendations (and ours) in the context of what is 1.0. Introduction Linear algebra is a stalwart of the undergraduate mathematics experience, one of the core areas of mathematics whose “unreasonable effectiveness” finds critical application in disciplines ranging from business analytics to quantum computing. Most universities offer a first course in linear algebra, although what such a course entails varies from one institution to another. Our goal in this paper is to review the status of a first course in linear algebra in the US and Canada through an instructor survey and then discuss ways in which an updated linear algebra curriculum might better serve its constituents. In our survey, 70% of instructors report their course is a service course for computer science, data science, economics, or engineering majors (only about 25% of the institutions use linear algebra as an introduction-to-proof course). At the same time, universities have seen a recent dramatic increase in computing majors (a 200% increase between Report on a US-Canadian Faculty Survey on Undergraduate Linear Algebra Could Linear Algebra Be an Alternate First Collegiate Math Course?"

 Machine Learning (ML), a branch of Artificial Intelligence, now competes with human experts in many specialized biomedical fields and will play an increasing role in precision medicine. As with any other technological advance in medicine, the keys to understanding must be integrated into practitioner training. To respond to this challenge, this viewpoint discusses some necessary changes in the health studies curriculum to help practitioners interpret decisions made by a machine and question them in relation to the patient's medical context. The complexity of technology and the inherent criticality of its use in medicine also necessitate a new medical profession. To achieve this objective, this viewpoint will propose new medical practitioners, with skills both in medicine and in data science, The Doctor in Medical Data Sciences.

The lectures on these topics cannot stand alone without coding practice on real-world data sets. Some instructors prefer to utilize small data sets for practice in classroom or assignments, which limits experimental experiences and may even bring misleading experiences to students. Others may try to assign large data sets to students, but students may not be able to bear with the running time due to the efficiency issue raised by several factors (e.g., data size, algorithm complexity, computing power, etc.). In this paper, we first learned students’ preferences on the scalability of data sets for practice in data science courses, and performed experimental analysis by running different data science algorithms over both student laptops and personal/office computers, in order to deliver a suggestion about the appropriate data size for practice in multiple scenarios (e.g., in-class practice, assignments, class projects, research projects, etc.). We believe that our findings are valuable to help instructors prepare and assign real-world data sets to students in data science curriculum."

This situation serves as a demonstration of the entrenched misconception that biology is a math-free zone. Historically, biology began as an observational science. Even Darwin described evolution with minimal quantitative analysis in The Origin of Species . Things have changed drastically since 1859, and quantitative biology is now (or at least should be) an integral component of the life sciences. Modern biology has access to unprecedented amounts of exciting data, which can be managed only with quantitative tools, including those from emerging fields like data science. Staying on top of this rapidly changing field is a daunting task; keeping our teaching up-to-date is an even greater challenge.

At community colleges and beyond, supporting students' development of quantitative skills must occupy a growing position in the curriculum.

IDC predicts that by 2020, the company's expenditure based on big data computing and analysis platform will exceed 500 billion US dollars, and the compound growth rate will reach 34.1% in the next 5 years; in the next 3 to 5 years, China needs 1.8 million data talents, but currently only About 300,000 people. At the same time, China's colleges and universities in cloud computing, data science and other majors are still in their infancy, and the talents cultivated each year are far from meeting the needs of the industry. Therefore, it is imperative to open a big data major and accelerate the cultivation of talents. The financial industry is the industry that relies most on data and is the easiest to realize data. In recent years, emerging financial institutions such as consumer loans and P2P are the products of the combination of big data technology and finance. At present, the demand for big data talents in finance is extremely strong in China. Only Internet finance is one year, and the growth rate is 3-5 times per year.

The objective of this work was to identify the effect of the presence or not of the disciplines Philosophy and Sociology in the High School curriculum on the students' learning. In terms of methodology, data from the Census of Basic Education 2015 and from the averaged per school performances in the ENEM 2015 were examined by means of several Data Science techniques more specifically, with the resources of the language R. The results of the analysis did not indicate any perceptible influence of the disciplines Philosophy and Sociology on the performance, unlike the Indicator of Student’s Socioeconomic Status and the Administrative Dependence of the School. These results seem to contradict the significant positive ones obtained after activities conducted by teachers trained in investigative philosophical dialogue in the classroom. Far from taking sides in the discussion about the pertinence of the inclusion of these disciplines in High School, what was sought here was to point out the need for a rethink about how they should be organised."

Topics such as machine learning, data science, and concurrency and parallelism have grown in importance over the last few years. As the content of our curriculum changes, so too does the mathematical foundations on which it rests. Do our current theoretical courses adequately support these foundations or must we consider new pedagogy that is more relevant to our students' needs? In this BoF, we will discuss what a modern mathematics curriculum for computer scientists should cover and how we should go about accomplishing this in our classrooms."

Our goal was to cover basic coding topics and data science concepts through live coding and hands-on practice. However, we could not find a resource that exactly met our needs. Therefore, over the past three years, we have developed a curriculum and instructional format using Jupyter notebooks to effectively teach introductory Python for data science. This method, inspired by The Carpentries organization, uses bite-sized lessons followed by independent practice time to reinforce coding concepts, and culminates in a data science capstone project using real-world data. We believe our open curriculum is a valuable resource to the wider education community and hope that educators will use and improve our lessons, practice problems, and teaching best practices.

As the discipline of statistics education broadens to data science education, there is a need to examine how practices in data science can inform work in K-12. We synthesize literature about statistics investigation processes, data science as a field and practices of data scientists. Further, we provide results from an ethnographic and interview study of the work of data scientists. Together, these inform a new framework to support data investigation processes. We explicate the practices and dispositions needed and offer a glimpse of how the framework can be used to move the discipline of data science education forward.   "

As the availability of programs in data analytics and data science grows based on market demands, the need for foundational technical skills is important to equip graduates for readily available entry level jobs in the field. While the available literature contains elements of application of big data into the classroom, mainstream tools like Apache Hadoop have not been readily addressed. This paper evaluates two different methods of providing students exposure to Hadoop through either an on-premise cluster or virtual machines. A curriculum is provided for students to gain hands-on experience through lab exercises, assessed through preand post-quizzes to test understanding. In addition, student work is assessed for application and analysis in a Business Intelligence and Big Data undergraduate course. This work contributes to the information systems (I.S.) community by providing foundational elements essential for integrating software tools such as Hadoop, Hive, and Spark into coursework."

The FAIR (Findable – Accessible – Interoperable - Reusable) data management principles and data stewardship provide a foundation for effective research data management. The 2018 “Turning FAIR into Reality” report and other documents recommend that data skills should be more widely included in university curricula and that a concerted effort should be made to coordinate and accelerate the pedagogy for professional data roles. Throughout Europe and beyond, many organisations, projects and initiatives work on providing training on FAIR data competences. However, wider adoption of the FAIR data culture can be achieved by including FAIR competences into university curricula. This paper presents the ongoing work of the FAIRsFAIR project to develop a Data Stewardship competence framework and to provide recommendations for implementing this framework in university curricula by means of defining the Data Stewardship Body of Knowledge Model Curricula. The proposed approach and identified competences and knowledge topics are supported by a job market analysis. The presented work is actively using the EDISON Data Science Framework as a basis for Data Stewardship competences definition and methodology for linking competences, skills, knowledge, and intended learning outcomes when designing curricula."

We describe their relationship and argue for their importance. Based on this, we then present the Bootstrap:Data Science curriculum, designed for integration into multiple disciplines and settings. It achieves this by (a) being designed as a set of remix-able lessons, and (b) letting classes and students choose personally meaningful datasets. We also initiate the process of evaluating this curriculum. We create two assessment instruments, one focused on learning and the other on personalization and engagement.

c71472a21a0fa231e87cd665b6e466a3aba9ce22,enhancing quantitative and data science education for graduate students in biomedical science,"Substantial guidance is available on undergraduate quantitative training for biologists, including reports focused on biomedical science, but far less attention has been paid to the graduate curriculum. In this setting, we propose an innovative approach to quantitative education that goes beyond recommendations of a course or set of courses or activities. Due to the diversity of quantitative methods, it is infeasible to expect that biomedical PhD students can be exposed to more than a minority of the quantitative concepts and techniques employed in modern biology. We developed a novel prioritization approach in which we mined and analyzed quantitative concepts and skills from publications that faculty in relevant units deemed central to the scientific comprehension of their field. The analysis provides a prioritization of quantitative skills and concepts and could represent an effective method to drive curricular focus based upon program-specific faculty input for biological science programs of all types. Our results highlight the disconnect between typical undergraduate quantitative education for life science students, focused on continuous mathematics, and the concepts and skills in graphics, statistics, and discrete mathematics that arise from priorities established by biomedical science faculty. One Sentence Summary We developed a novel approach to prioritize quantitative concepts and methods for inclusion in a graduate biomedical science curriculum based upon approaches included in faculty-identified key publications."

Abstract We discuss opportunities and challenges encountered in developing new undergraduate degree programs that are inherently cross-disciplinary and require institutional and instructional support from different departments and colleges. We have recently been involved in early stages of curriculum development for an undergraduate BA/BS Data Analytics program at Washington State University (WSU), involving faculty and resources from Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics, College of Business, and other units at the University. The development of such a new degree program required developing entirely new courses and their syllabi, identifying faculty across the existing academic units suitable and available to teach those new courses, as well as identifying key existing courses across Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics and Business that should be incorporated into the new degree program. One challenge there was to ensure providing the solid foundations and a right balance to the future Data Analytics graduates, without making their BA/BS degree program require substantially more credit hours than the existing undergraduate programs in e.g. Statistics, Mathematics or the Data Science ""track"" in Computer Science. We share some insights from this curriculum development process. Some issues that we have encountered include the following: what are the most important skills that the future BA or BS graduates in Data Analytics should acquire from computational and computer science standpoints? Is requiring those students to take the existing CS courses on Data Mining, Machine Learning or Database Systems appropriate, or should new courses (not shared with the existing CS Data Science or similar ""tracks"") be developed? What is the right balance between training in computational (and mathematical) foundations, vs. various application domains, such as in business or life sciences? One of the key early lessons we have learned: effective, respectful and cooperative communication across the traditional disciplinary boundaries is absolutely crucial for intrinsically cross-disciplinary higher-education undertakings such as developing a new data analytics degree program to be successful."

Background: Today’s data science requires students and prospective data scientists to have a strong foundational background in statistical analysis methods and decision making. Given the diversity of students' profiles, and a multitude of statistical analysis curricula across the USA, we seek to provide guidelines on a curriculum that is in line with today’s data demanding era. Intended outcomes: The target audience comprises students in engineering courses that deal with data and seek to obtain a domain-specific technological or societal solution. Using a learnby-mistake approach, we try to mend some of the most common mistakes in statistical analysis for the new generations of data professionals. The proposed curriculum equips students with multiple statistical methodologies that enable them to understand, process, extract, visualize, and communicate statistical evidence. Application design: We propose a systems engineering approach to design the curriculum that leverages tools and methodologies from operations research and statistics. Findings: Our approach ensures that the designed ‘Statistical Analysis’ course satisfies some of the intended constraints and goals by design. In particular, we designed an overarching handson example that integrates the topics covered in the curriculum into a transversal example and can be further customized to the different students’ profiles."

Moreover, data science, implemented carefully, opens accessible pathways to stem for students for whom neither mathematics nor computer science are natural affinities, and who would traditionally be excluded. We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' first exposure to data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. The intent of this approach is to support students, regardless of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry. This discussion is presented in the context of the International Data Science in Schools Project which recently published computer science and statistics consensus curriculum frameworks for a two-year secondary school data science program, designed to make data science accessible to all."

Here and in many other contexts, data literacy is characterised in terms of a combination of numerical, statistical and technical capacities. In this article, we argue for an expansion of the concept to include not just competencies in reading and working with datasets but also the ability to account for, intervene around and participate in the wider socio-technical infrastructures through which data is created, stored and analysed – which we call “data infrastructure literacy”. We illustrate this notion with examples of “inventive data practice” from previous and ongoing research on open data, online platforms, data journalism and data activism. Drawing on these perspectives, we argue that data literacy initiatives might cultivate sensibilities not only for data science but also for data sociology, data politics as well as wider public engagement with digital data infrastructures. The proposed notion of data infrastructure literacy is intended to make space for collective inquiry, experimentation, imagination and intervention around data in educational programmes and beyond, including how data infrastructures can be challenged, contested, reshaped and repurposed to align with interests and publics other than those originally intended."

We detail the process starting with the acquisition of (real) data from a peer-to-peer lending platform all the way to the development and evaluation of investment strategies based on a variety of approaches. We focus heavily on how to apply and evaluate the data science methods, and resulting strategies, in a real-world business setting. The material presented in this article can be used by instructors who teach data science courses, at the undergraduate or graduate levels. Importantly, we go beyond just evaluating predictive performance of models, to assess how well the strategies would actually perform, using real, publicly available data. Our treatment is comprehensive and ranges from qualitative to technical, but is also modular—which gives instructors the flexibility to focus on specific parts of the case, depending on the topics they want to cover. The learning concepts include the following: data cleaning and ingestion, classification/probability estimation modeling, regression modeling, analytical engineering, calibration curves, data leakage, evaluation of model performance, basic portfolio optimization, evaluation of investment strategies, and using Python for data science."

Selecting the wrong program costs students time, money, and considerable effort. Though several institutions have created curriculum guidelines for data science related programs, an overall consensus on program content does not exist at either the undergraduate or graduate levels. This paper examines the most common course requirements, such as data mining, machine learning, mathematics, software engineering, data analysis, and data visualization. We then compare the requirement analysis against the specifics of data science related programs offered at the Universidad de Lima, the Universidad Pacifico, and the University of St. Thomas. The results show that all three universities have active programs worth consideration and give students a model of what to look for when selecting their programs."
8a00affada456bff56e03720671347dc804c921b,madasca instruction of data science to managers,"Aim/Purpose: Build a program that teaches prospect managers the skills that are relevant for leading data science activity.

Background: Data science becomes ubiquitous in organizations. It is imperative to train students in management departments in the skills that are relevant to this field. Most courses in data science focus on technical knowledge like model building methods, and neglect organizational knowledge such as team roles, ethical considerations and project stages. This work suggests a complementary program that supplies the students with the required knowledge. The authors believe that this program is most suitable for management-students, and that it can also be adapted to software engineering students, in order to provide them with a wider scope.

Contribution: We present the MaDaScA (Managing Data Science Activity) program. The program defines a list of topics that are required for managers’ education in order to lead data science activity. This work suggests the content and take-away messages of each topic. The paper surveys several existing courses that teach data-science to managers. 

Findings: All existing courses supply a part of the suggested topics, either focusing on technical aspects of data-science or on organizational aspects. In particular, only a small minority of the courses discuss ethical aspects of data science. 

Recommendations for Practitioners: We recommend adopting MaDaScA in management departments in order to prepare managers for the challenges in data-science.

Recommendations for Researchers: We recommend adapting the MaDaScA model to the curriculum of the faculty of engineering, especially for the department of industrial engineering. 

Impact on Society: Educating prospect managers on the capabilities of data science and responsibilities that come with it is key for making sure organizations become much more data driven, efficient and ethical. 

Future Research: It is possible to make this program more effective by adding practical experience"

Through the use of critical social theory and critical theory of education as guiding frameworks, the dissertation examines an instantiation of STEM reform efforts to analyze the classroom participation structure that emerged in a piloted introduction to data science course at a local high school in one of the largest school districts in the country. The study is particularly concerned with identifying emergent classroom norms and practices, and understanding whether and how they came to support and/or hinder students’ opportunities to learn richly with data through an analysis of the development of student learning identities. This qualitative case study draws on audio-recorded student interviews, video-recorded classroom observations, and field notes collected during the second year of the curriculum’s implementation. To identify classroom norms and practices as they relate to the development of student identities as data science doers, the study examines the classroom participation structure (Cobb and Hodge, 2002) and employs Cobb, Gresalfi, and Hodge’s (2009) interpretive scheme for analyzing the development of mathematical student identity (also see Cobb a Hodge, 2010). While the multiperspectival approach of this study will provide innovatively insightful contributions to a number of fields including education, cultural studies, data and computer science, the study will also push how educators, learning science researchers, curriculum writers, and policymakers think about the pursuit of equity in STEM education in general and data science-oriented programs and initiatives in particular as they relate to STEM reform efforts."

This new reality challenges the effectiveness of traditional narrowly oriented professional education. New areas of competences emerged as a synergy of multiple knowledge areas – transdisciplines. Informing Science and Data Science are just the first two such new areas we may identify as transdisciplines. Universities are facing the challenge to educate students for those new realities. 

Background: The purpose of the paper is to share the authors’ experience in designing curriculum for training bachelor students in Informing Science as a concentration within an Information Brokerage major, and a master program on Data Science.

Methodology: Designing curriculum for transdisciplines requires diverse expertise obtained by both academia and industries and passed through several stages - identifying objectives, conceptualizing curriculum models, identifying content, and development pedagogical priorities.

Contribution: Sharing our experience acquired in designing transdiscipline programs will contribute to a transition from a narrow professional education towards addressing 21st-century challenges.

Findings: Analytical skills, combined with training in all categories of so-called “soft skills”, are essential in preparing students for a successful career in a transdiciplinary area of activities.

Recommendations for Practitioners: Establishing a working environment encouraging not only sharing but close cooperation is essential nowadays.

Recommendations for Researchers: There are two aspects of training professionals capable of succeeding in a transdisciplinary environment: encouraging mutual respect and developing out-of-box thinking.

Impact on Society: The transition of higher education in a way to meet current challenges.

Future Research The next steps in this research are to collect feedback regarding the professional careers of students graduating in these two programs and to adjust the curriculum accordingly."

Data science training for students in higher education necessitates well-equipped and confident instructors across curricula. However, not all instructors are versed in data science skills or research-based teaching practices. Our study sought to survey the state of data science education across institutions of higher learning, identify instructor needs, and illuminate barriers to teaching data science in the classroom. We distributed a survey to instructors around the world, focused on the United States, and received 106 complete responses. Our results indicate that instructors across institutions use, teach, and view data management, analysis, and visualization as important for students to learn. Code, modeling, and reproducibility were less valued by instructors, although there were differences by institution type (doctoral, masters, or baccalaureate), and career stage (time since terminal degree). While there were a variety of barriers highlighted by respondents, instructor background, student background, and space in the curriculum were the greatest barriers of note. Interestingly, instructors were most interested in receiving training for how to teach code and data analysis in the undergraduate classroom. Our study provides an important window into how data science is taught in higher education as well as suggestions for how we can best move forward with empowering instructors across disciplines."

This article focused its investigation on acquisition of data science skills in building partnership for efficient school curriculum delivery in Africa, especially in the area of teaching statistics courses at the beginners’ level in tertiary institutions. Illustrations were made using Big data of selected 18 African countries sourced from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) with special focus on some macro-economic variables that drives economic policy. Data description techniques were adopted in the analysis of the sourced open data with the aid of R analytics software for data science, as improvement on the traditional methods of data description for learning and thus open a new charter of education curriculum delivery in African schools. Though, the collaboration is not without its own challenges, its prospects in creating self-driven learning culture among students of tertiary institutions has greatly enhanced the quality of teaching, advancing students skills in machine learning, improved understanding of the role of data in global perspective and being able to critique claims based on data."
04cca062e860f9924b5bcaf0c2061818ae6d7e9b,a modular ethics curriculum for computer science,"To address the challenging issues presented to a technology-driven generation, we have been designing and testing 15-20 minute modules with conversations surrounding ethical issues in computing and data science. The goal is to meet the needs of current students by incorporating engaging activities, including demonstrations, debates, and interactive quizzes, to maintain their interest and promote critical thinking. The short length of the modules allows them to fit with packed courses and short attention spans. The curriculum is designed to lay the groundwork in the first year, giving a basic understanding of four ethical frameworks. In years two through four, students gain practice in recognizing course material-related dilemmas and in applying these frameworks to find ethical solutions. Additionally, we are developing comprehensive background materials so that professors with limited experience in ethics can easily implement the modules in their classrooms, and students who do not experience the foundational modules will not feel lost. Through workshops, focus groups, and in-class testing of the materials, teachers and students have shown excitement and support for the curriculum, and students not typically engaged in class have found their voice. Verbal and written feedback have shown that the module activities have been successful in helping students evaluate the ethicality of challenging computing-related situations and in effectively articulating their conclusions. To date, twelve modules have been tested, modified, and in some cases re-tested. We are looking forward to sharing our results. Many of the materials created will be available for examination."

Educated and/or trained Data Scientist is becoming a critical component of the whole data driven science and technology ecosystem. It is important to revisit the Data Scientist Professional definition propose/identify effective approaches to Data Science competences and skills assessment that would allow developing customisable education and training curricula that would support organisational capacity building (effective HR management) and individual career development. The paper is discussing how the EDISON Data Science Framework can be used to solve these problems. New approaches to Data Science competences assessment is proposed that introduces the concept of acquired competence which is calculated based on the practitioner career path. Important aspect in targeted education and training for professionals is correct and effective education path building based on initial competences and knowledge assessment. The paper proposes a new approach in customised curriculum building by applying Bloom's Taxonomy to training courses sequence and timing/scheduling.

I read the document and attended a few sessions of SIGCSE 2014 presented by members of this Task Force. I also co-chaired a Birds-of-a-Feather session at SIGCSE 2015 to begin a conversation about how to interpret and implement CS2013 suggestions where mathematics meets computer science education. I intend to keep my promise and look to how mathematics intersects CS2013 here, as well as summarize and continue the discussion started in spring 2015. Before I begin, I urge you to read Peter Henderson's overview of CS2013 [3] if only for the detailed description of the evolution of computer science from mathematics, engineering and other scientific areas. He also shows how rigor helped computer science to move beyond mere "" playing with tools "" and into a bona fide academic discipline. While Peter wrote about the Ironman Draft, his thoughts still apply to the final release. The most evident place where mathematics appears in CS2013 is in the "" Body of Knowledge "" as discrete structures. Briefly stated, the discrete structures knowledge area covers sets, relations, and functions, logic and proof techniques, basic counting, graphs and trees, and discrete probability. CS2013 nicely captures the foundational nature of these concepts, with illustrations about how they appear in various areas throughout computing, appearances that provide opportunities to reinforce and to deepen understanding. Generally, institutions cover this material somewhere along the spectrum from offering a single discrete mathematics course required of all computer science students to injecting these topics into "" ... courses on programming, algorithms and/or artificial intelligence. "" There are other examples and courses mentioned. I was quite pleased to see a clear statement on the importance of proof "" ... in virtually every area of computer science. "" An appendix section on migrating from CC2001 to CS2013 [1] gives a concise summary of differences for each knowledge area. For discrete structures, there is a small shift in coverage time, and thus emphasis, from topics in logic to those in probability, perhaps to address recent trends in computer science such as data science. Regarding priority, 37 out of 43 topics in the discrete structures knowledge area are denoted as Tier-1 topics, those that "" ... should be a required part of every Computer …"
73756c2c82a05f2630bf2ea09cbe2552dacf2342,you teach what in your data science course,"Data scientists - practitioners, researchers, and educators - often disagree on the definition of data science. Data science courses are taught by faculty in departments of computer science, statistics, and business analytics as well allied fields. Some data scientists create scalable dashboards, others employ and (hopefully) explain machine learning models, most (but not all) demand data wrangling and visualization skills, and some require theoretical knowledge to develop novel algorithmic and/or analytic techniques. How, then, do we determine what content should be covered in an introductory college-level data science course? Some serve as prerequisites while others are terminal experiences for non-majors (who we secretly hope to entice into the field). Some courses require prior knowledge of statistical methods, databases, or programming, uniting heterogeneous populations of students and demanding flexibility regarding programming language(s) utilized or allowed. Realistically, we often make expeditious choices because competing demands leave us hard-pressed to keep up-to-date with current skills and practices. BoF participants will share their decision processes and choices about content for an introductory data science course. Information will be shared, from participants and disseminated material, on resources and curriculum guides from various professional organizations. We welcome new and experienced data science instructors, educators planning on or interested in teaching such a course, and industrial practitioners experienced in working with or hiring undergraduates."

Therefore, academic institutions have started to offer different kind of data science DS programs and they strive to prepare students to be data scientists who are capable to face the challenge of the new age. As an interdisciplinary field, DS programs should represent a combination of subject areas from several disciplines. Consequently, schools that host data science programs are diverse. Until now few studies have investigated data science programs within a particular discipline, such as Business (e.g. Chen et al.). However, there are very few empirical studies that explore DS programs and investigate its curriculum structure across disciplines. This study conducted an exploratory content analysis of 30 United States’ DS programs from a variety of disciplines. The present study seeks to depict the current state of DS education in the U.S. to explore what discipline DS programs covers at the graduate level. The analysis was conducted on course titles and course descriptions. The results show that DS programs required varying numbers of credit hours, including practicum and capstone. Management schools seem to take the lead and the initiative in lunching and hosting DS programs. It can be said that all DS programs requires the basic knowledge of database design, representation, extraction and management. DS programs delivered information skills through their core courses. Results indicates that almost 40 percent of required courses in DS programs is involved information representations, retrieval and programming. Required courses also addressed communication visualization and mathematics skills."

Thus, the aim of the present study was to reveal the reality of data science education in the Middle East and to determine the opportunities and challenges for teaching data science in the region. Thirteen countries in the Middle East were offering 48 data science programmes at the time of the study. The results reveal that these data science programmes significantly use the words ‘data’ and ‘analytics’ in their names. With regard to the academic affiliations of the data science programmes, the study found that they are offered in a variety of schools, especially computer science, information technology and business. Moreover, the study found that computer science is the dominant trend in the programmes. Data science programmes have a significant overlap with other programmes, especially statistics and computer science, because of the interdisciplinary nature of this field. Data science schools in the Middle East differ in terms of their programme titles, programme descriptions, course catalogues, curriculum structures and course objectives. Broadly, this study may be useful for those who are seeking to establish a data science programme or to strengthen data science curricula at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels."

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms transform the analysis, diagnosis, and treatment of medical conditions. Complex and massive data sets are informing significant health care decisions and clinical practices. The ability to read, manage, and interpret large data sets to provide data-driven care and to protect patient privacy are increasingly critical skills for today’s health care providers. Objective The aim of this study is to accelerate the appropriate adoption of data-driven and AI-enhanced care by focusing on the mindsets, skillsets, and toolsets of point-of-care health providers and their leaders in the health system. Methods To accelerate the adoption of AI and the need for organizational change at a national level, our multistepped approach includes creating awareness and capacity building, learning through innovation and adoption, developing appropriate and strategic partnerships, and building effective knowledge exchange initiatives. Education interventions designed to adapt knowledge to the local context and address any challenges to knowledge use include engagement activities to increase awareness, educational curricula for health care providers and leaders, and the development of a coaching and practice-based innovation hub. Framed by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we are currently in the knowledge creation stage to inform the curricula for each deliverable. An environmental scan and scoping review were conducted to understand the current state of AI education programs as reported in the academic literature. Results The environmental scan identified 24 AI-accredited programs specific to health providers, of which 11 were from the United States, 6 from Canada, 4 from the United Kingdom, and 3 from Asian countries. The most common curriculum topics across the environmental scan and scoping review included AI fundamentals, applications of AI, applied machine learning in health care, ethics, data science, and challenges to and opportunities for using AI. Conclusions Technologies are advancing more rapidly than organizations, and professionals can adopt and adapt to them. To help shape AI practices, health care providers must have the skills and abilities to initiate change and shape the future of their discipline and practices for advancing high-quality care within the digital ecosystem.

34f135fe333b2054b1ede8f3a7e22ac1c357bb39,who what when and how changing the undergraduate statistics curriculum a discussion of mere renovation is too little too late,"First, and foremost, we largely agree with the underlying themes presented by Professor Cobb: the need for a curriculum that attracts, inspires and engages students preparing them for the data and analysis questions they will face in their future; that the curriculum of statistics needs to evolve to include more modern tools; our profession (and discipline) is in danger of being superseded by computer science, business analytics and bioinformatics; and the need for a curriculum that is dynamic in the face of the evolving role of data science, mathematics and computing. The manuscript is a provocative and interesting piece that generated a good conversation between us and we expect that it will do the same for our colleagues. The four threads outlined are particularly noteworthy and the analogy to the fast food industry is chillingly accurate. With all that said, the manuscript raised several intertwined questions about the implications of such a dramatic shift to the curriculum. These can be summarized in three main discussion points. The first is on the role of curriculum, the second is a question of scale and the third is on the topic of competition and collaboration. As described by Professor Cobb, historically intro courses were based on sampling distribution theory and required some mathematical chops to grasp the probabilistic and statistical rationale. Applications with real data were a secondary consideration and many statistical results were taught as a mathematical recipe for different types of theoretical data. Although the standard intro course has evolved to a more data driven approach and to include various computing techniques, the same build up from probability through inference is typically taught. Before we can completely abandon this approach, we need to address a fundamental question: What is the role of introductory statistics classes in the curriculum? From our perspective, our introductory courses serve three distinct clientele: all students (think the general public), statistical doers (majors requiring skills with data and analysis—the sciences) and proto-statisticians (those majoring in statistics, mathematics or computer science or who may get an advanced degree in the area). The teaching goals for each of these groups can be quite different and can be summarized as literacy, rationale and comprehension, respectively. The discussed revolution of the curriculum appears to largely concentrate on the rationale of statistics, moving to a more intuitive algorithmic approach, which in our mind largely serv es"

While there is a broad agreement about underlying principles in this new discipline, defining data science as a pedagogically independent discipline has proven to be a challenge.In this paper, we present the university-wide effort that led to the creation of a new undergraduate interdisciplinary Data Science program. In particular, we point to the critical role of inclusive pedagogical design and broadening participation criteria in program development. Current and projected job market data clearly indicate that data science programs need to expand traditional STEM workforce and attract students with varying backgrounds and degrees or preparation.

They have to organize and analyze these data, and they must find the meaning or value of the ever-expanding and increasingly complex data pile, which is said to have exceeded the capability of conventional data processing applications to process it. The condition of this kind of data is also categorized as Big Data, which is interpreted as a set of data in a very large number of challenges lies in how the data should be stored, how to search in the pile of data, how to distribute it, how to visualize it, and how the data should be analyzed. The long-term goal of IbKIK's proposed program is the establishment of a startup company in the field of analytic data from the world of campus directly. Within the planned three-year period, it is desirable that the company be financially self-sufficient by being a data analytics consultant and also creating a sophisticated and advanced Big Data Analytic application platform product. The advantages possessed when the company started from the academic world is the quantity and quality of human resources as intellectual actors can be selected quickly and accurately. Especially with the synchronization between the curriculum content that is taught with its implementation directly through the program IbKIK become useful products and economic value. From the academic point of view, the desired outcomes are from this program published several journals and proceedings of national and international scale, the publication of textbooks, getting HKI, and publications in the mass media. Also, with the success of this company can produce a derivative company engaged in other areas that are still related as a supporter of the business. The product output of the community service activity that has been done for the first year of the planned three years period is the establishment of a Product Information System Sold on E-Commerce Transactions at Market Place. Also, has been established research unit as the forerunner of the business unit under the auspices of the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology University of Sumatera Utara under the name Data Science Research Group."

Readers may be aware of the International Data Science in Schools Project (IDSSP) www.idssp.org and may have read the draft curriculum frameworks for Units 1 and 2. Some readers may have provided feedback in response to the consultation call at http://www.idssp.org/ pages/consultation.html. The draft curricula are called frameworks because they are intended to guide, and inspire, the writing, resourcing, and teaching of curricula at either senior school or introductory tertiary levels, appropriate for local conditions. Hence, the emphasis is on framing approaches to content, content pedagogy, sequencing, and learning experiences. Most of Unit 1 will be familiar to all those involved in statistics education advocacy and developments in teaching practice over the past few decades. The approach and key elements of Unit 1 can be described by the following:"

Even in the intro stats course, many students are using R to support their coursework rather than applet or “point-and-click” software systems. Introducing computation earlier in the statistics and data science curriculum enables students to work deeper and sooner with real data sets. Changes in early statistics and data science education have a ripple effect across the curriculum. As the introductory courses are modernized, the later courses must change too. The class described in this paper is a second-semester statistical modeling course with a modern, post-data science flair. Regression models are introduced separately (multiple regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression) before being generalized as the generalized linear model (GLM). In this class, learners studied the patterns and behaviors of these models through targeted labs leaning heavily on simulated data. This course emphasizes the development of statistical intuition through hands-on learning experiences, rather than a set of rules for each situation."
9662542f7c2ba4a2c1db36ad1b32ba9f7caa7670,professional development for high school computer science teachers on data science through a feminist lens,"This Research-to-Practice Work in Progress paper presents a recent professional development for high school computer science teachers. The court system increasingly relies on algorithms to rate a criminal defendant's likelihood of recidivism. These algorithms utilize machine learning models tuned on biased datasets, resulting in false assessments. There are several other alerting examples of how a software engineer's personal bias affects their design and development of technology. This bias leads to poor usability of technology for underserved groups. Data science applies machine learning on massive datasets to invent new technology to improve everyday life from healthcare to consumer needs. Designing and developing data science solutions for a diverse population requires an unbiased approach. Data feminism, which emerges from the intersecting fields of data science and feminist theory, presents a methodology to solve data science problems given three principles: 1) invent new ways to represent data unknowns, 2) invent new ways to reference the material economy behind the data, 3) make dissent possible. In this paper, we present a case study on a week-long online professional development for computer science high school teachers on data science using a data feminist lens. We discuss the data science tools and technology taught during the weeklong event. We share examples of the data feminism principles and class exercises. The computer science teachers also participated in community building activities. The culminating weeklong challenge was to analyze an earthquake dataset, which included themes of socioeconomic disparity within a city. The teachers worked in teams to explore this dataset with the new data science techniques and recommend resource management solutions for a city's earthquake response. In this paper, we explore the question: how the participating computer science high school teachers incorporate data feminism into their data science pipeline? We analyze the audio transcripts collected during the week to create visual analytics on our findings. We consider the impacts of culturally responsive approaches to computer science K-12 curriculum and future professional development in this space."

The main goal of the study was to examine areas in which the content of the curriculum should be focused on Textiles and Clothing related disciplines. As research methods, a qualitative analysis of literature search was conducted during a period of Fulbright scholar study at a US institution to compare content offered in textiles and clothing-related programs. The outcome of the study declares the areas such as exponential disruptive technologies in the textiles and clothing integrated enterprise, brand innovation, supply chain management, data science in the curriculum, and sustainable design and manufacturing as gap areas that were not thoroughly included in the existing programs in Zimbabwe. These content areas should be considered as part of the review to align the programs with the essence of Education 5.0."

And, advances in algorithms and computing power have allowed us to analyse this data more quickly. But data is only
 as useful as the questions being asked and analysed. For this reason, researchers at Aichi University of Education in Japan are working to revamp the way data analysis and statistics are taught to students. Their goal is to provide students with a better understanding of the power of data
 and statistical analyses and go beyond simply calculating stats and returning the correct answers on exams. Professor Kazuhiro Aoyama is working with colleagues, including Professor Yoshinori Fujii of University of Miyazaki and Professor Yuichi Oguchi of Ibaraki University, to develop
 a new educational curriculum for data analysis and statistics and test it in classrooms all over Japan. The goal of the new curriculum being tested in classrooms revolves around a concept called intellectual information creativity. This concept reflects a student's ability to use
 their imagination when confronted with a dataset in order to make sense of and interpret the characteristics of the data. In an era when data processing can be done quickly with software, it is necessary for human beings to find meaning from data and education should teach students to engage
 in activities to discover new information."

Industrial revaluations and knowledge economies have raised the demand for a knowledgeable and digitally equipped skilled workforce. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is an educational stream that provides vocational skills to youth and produces a skilled workforce for the industry. The role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the TVET pedagogy, training delivery, teachers training, curriculum, and labs is need of the day to meet current era challenges. In the TVET education training cycle, the level of ICT enablement is required to be reviewed. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) evaluates literature for innovation of ICT in TVET education for the last ten years. This study aims to identify and present ICT-based technology innovations, research, and applications used in TVET training cycle system components/functional areas to identify gaps for future research directions/agenda. This gap identification will help (i) TVET training institutes to upgrade their teachers, curriculum, labs and, equipment, (ii) policymakers to devise technology-oriented skilled workforce development policies, (iii) to provide guidelines to industry, researchers, and academics to focus on gaps to address future challenges of workforce development. Based on the search string, we found 2,445 relevant documents and after applying quality assurance and inclusion/exclusion criteria, finally, 134 documents were selected for the study and analyzed. The result of this systematic literature review identifies that ICT technologies and application dispersion into TVET training cycle system components/functional areas is very low particularly in monitoring and evaluation, career guidance and job placement, trainee’s assessment, and teacher’s training. TVET Technology index suggests that much focus is needed on IoT, Robotics, Data Science, Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and other similar technology induction to all TVET training."
08d63f344611794065246848f1048b95e8d657e7,using inquirybased learning in engineering statistics courses,"Many engineering students struggle with a first course in statistics. One of the reasons for this is that statistics differs from “traditional” mathematics curriculum, such as calculus and differential equations. Merely giving students problem sets does not teach them to think in a particular fashion, as statistics problems require the assimilation of more varied information than using formulas or even applying those formulas to situational (story) problems to solve for a particular variable or variables. Data rarely conforms to contrived values, so the student's ability to critically think and make decisions is of paramount importance. Since statistics is different from a traditional mathematics discipline, we feel it is necessary to differentiate instruction from a traditional mathematics class. Because statistics and data science requires considerable decision-making processes and analytical ability, we feel that elements of inquiry-based learning will be beneficial to students. These inquiry-based lessons will be provided in the form of POGIL, or Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning, activities designed to lead small groups of students through specific material within a specific subject domain."

Aus diesem Grund erscheint es uns immens wichtig, diese Fragestellungen und Technologien auch in den Unterricht der Sekundarstufe II zu integrieren. Um diesem Anspruch gerecht zu werden, entwickelten wir im Rahmen eines Forschungsprojekts ein Curriculum, welches wir als konkretes Unterrichtskonzept innerhalb eines Projektkurses erprobt, evaluiert weiterentwickelt wird. Bei der Implementierung entschieden wir uns, zur aktiven Umsetzung von Konzepten von ML als Plattform Jupyter Notebook mit Python zu verwenden, da diese Umgebung durch die Verbindung von Code und Hypertext zur Dokumentation und Erklarung Medienbruche im Lernprozess verringern kann. Zudem ist Python zur Implementierung der Methoden von ML sehr gut geeignet. Im Themenfeld des ML als Teilgebiet der KI legen wir den Fokus auf zwei unterschiedliche Lernverfahren um verschieden Aspekte von ML, u.A. wie Nachvollziehbarkeit unter gesellschaftlichen Gesichtspunkten zu vermitteln. Diese sind Kunstliche Neuronale Netze (bei denen die Berechnung und Bedeutung der Kantengewichte zwischen den Neuronen fur den Menschen insbesondere bei komplexeren Netzen kaum nachvollziehbar erschienen) und Entscheidungsbaume (strukturierte und gerichtete Baume zur Darstellung von Entscheidungsregeln, welche auch fur Schulerinnen und Schuler meist gut nachvollziehbares und verstandliches KI-Modell darstellen). In diesem Workshop stellen wir konkrete Umsetzungsbeispiele inklusive der Programmierung fur beide Verfahren mit Jupyter Notebook und Python als Teil einer Unterrichtssequenz vor und diskutieren diese."
cd66ccc22bd0f32347b3fab962d175ae40e74f3b,data science recruiting comforting and intertwining multidisciplinary students in the general education curriculum,"Data Science is a general education course that was introduced at Temple University by the Department of Management Information Systems in 2014 (Schuff, 2018). Every organization uses data that crosses every field and every job. The use of data is no longer just the job of technologists; it is a requirement for all who want to participate in the knowledge economy. Data is readily available in a format that the average employee can use. Whether it is web traffic data provided through Google or crime data provided by government-sponsored open data initiatives. The course, which is open to all across the university, gives students the practical, applied skills necessary to work with data. This includes its selection and assessment, analysis, visualization and presentation. Students complete a series of hands-on, computer-based in-class exercises using available software tools. The exercises are designed for beginners with little technology experience. The course outcomes include learning how to do an original data analysis to create visualizations and an infographic that tells the story with solutions to a problem. Overall the course has been very successful with robust enrollment (32 sections consisting of 1522 students since 2014) and satisfaction (average student feedback score of 4.2 out of 5). However, there are several enduring challenges: Issue 1--Recruiting students from multiple disciplines outside of the business school: Students default to staying ‘home’ preferring to take courses in their own school. To address this lack of awareness, we (a) meet with advisors across the university, (b) produce and hand out postcards about the course, (c) offer a university wide competition in data analysis, and (d) appoint student ambassadors, who are involved in their home college through student organizations and can help ‘spread the word’. Issue 2--Fear of Technology: How do you bring together students from different disciplines and teach them about things that they are not familiar with? Even today, many students that take the course are fearful of technology and data analysis since it may not have been an emphasis in their major. To address this problem, (a) we repeatedly tell the students that they do not need prior experience to succeed in the course, and (b) assign a student worker to help the ones who struggle with the course content. Issue 3—Group work is difficult for students who come from different disciplines: Each student has learned a different style for group and project work. These differences lead to different ideas and arguments on how things need to be done. With regular intervention and guidance, the students learn to work together and this has led to great project results. For example, analyzing the top 100 songs on Spotify according to danceability, energy, loudness, valence and other filters. During the presentation, I will engage the audience in a discussion around the issues, possible solutions and next steps for integrating Data Science into the general education curriculum."

Although more and more schools are starting to teach machine learning and data science to undergraduates, these usually cover only supervised and unsupervised learning, causing students to graduate with a limited understanding of other important areas of machine learning. In this paper, we focus on one particularly exciting area, online machine learning. This area offers a fundamentally different perspective on learning, and has interesting theoretical underpinnings in addition to a large range of practical applications. Even though the fundamentals of this area are easy to understand, it is rarely taught and is not in the ACM/IEEE CS2013 curriculum recommendations. We present a short (roughly one hour) example unit which introduces online machine learning to undergraduates, and can be included at any point in an AI, data science, or machine learning course. (For supplementary material related to this unit see: http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/olteaching/.) A small pilot study with 13 student responses suggests that students find this unit engaging and highly valuable."

Finishing high school and going to university was supposed to be the way of opening up job opportunities, which is no longer the case. The gap between industries’ required skills and Higher Education Training methods is huge, even after past studies tried to find out where the problem lies. In this study, a literature survey was used to assist with the identification of existing shortcomings in training institutions, in particular the misalignment of Higher Education Training with the Industry expectations. To help understand Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how it has been applied before to solve human challenges problems. The ultimate goal is to design a model that helps bridge the skills gap between academic institutions and the industry. This model will have a component of mining data from existing curriculum documentation of Data Science, the results are to be reviewed and compared to the industry expected skillset to help design a preferred curriculum. The study used methods of research, analysis and data collection based on the mixed method of qualitative, survey distribution for deep understanding on how they are picking up this skills gap and what they recommend should be done to bridge the gap. This study is mainly focused on the Computing faculty in the Namibia University of Science and technology and First National Bank Namibia, which are considered to have or plan to have a data science department in the years to come. The results from this research are significant as they align the academic system to the skills required in the industry."

However, what do each of these phrases really mean? What are the distinctions between them, and how do they relate to one another? Although all of the phrases above are linked in some way, they cannot be substituted for one another. Whether you are an expert who is interested in data-driven research, a company owner who is ready to get the most out of current technology, or simply someone who wants to become more tech-savvy, this course is for you.The interdisciplinary field of data science refers to the study of gaining insight from large amounts of data. Consider, for example, the recommendation systems that are used to provide individualised recommendations to clients based on the history of their search activity. If two different customers search for different fishing-related things, such as rods and lures, and then one of those customers searches for fishing line in addition to the other products, there is a good possibility that the first client will also be interested in buying fishing line. Data science is a vast discipline that encompasses all of the activities and technology that assist develop such systems, especially those that are going to be discussed in the following paragraphs. The study of artificial intelligence is a difficult endeavour. Let's assume, however, for the purpose of clarity, that the term ""artificial intelligence"" may be used to any real-world data product. Let's continue to use the fishing analogy as our example. You want to purchase a certain model of fishing rod, but all you have is a photo of it, and you're not sure what brand it is. An artificial intelligence system is a piece of software that can analyse your photo and provide recommendations about a product name and stores where you may purchase the item. It is necessary to make advantage of machine learning and even deep learning sometimes while developing an AI product.The goal of machine learning is to instruct computers using historical information so that they can process new inputs based on previously learned patterns without the need for explicit programming. This means that the machines will be able to perform tasks without being given specific, hand-written instructions. It is difficult for a human to process millions of search queries, likes, and reviews to discover which customers commonly buy rods with lures and which customers purchase fishing line in addition to that. If it were not for machine learning, the recommendation engines that we have already mentioned above would be unattainable.Deep learning is the most talked about subfield in machine learning. It is characterised by the use of deep neural networks and complicated algorithms that are modelled after the way the human brain processes information. DL models are able to provide reliable findings from vast amounts of input data even when they are not provided with explicit instructions for which data features to examine. Imagine that you have the responsibility of identifying the fishing rods that lead to favourable reviews being posted on your website and those that lead to bad reviews being posted there. Deep neural networks have the ability to do sentiment analysis and extract significant attributes from reviews in this scenario. This contemporary book on ""Understanding Data Science (AI, ML & DL)"" focuses on the fundamentals of Data Science, illuminating how to grasp Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning in a more holistic manner.

Courses (and entire programs) have been appearing at such a fast rate at most institutions of higher education, as well as some high schools, that comparisons between curricular and delivery models and rigorous discipline-based education research are often overlooked in order to gain competitive advantages. This study attempts to rectify that absence by evaluating, comparing, and discussing four different courses offered at two different institutions of higher education. Funded by NSF via a collaborative grant (DUE-1432438), faculty from Computer Science and Statistics departments collaborated on the development and evaluation of introductory courses in Data Science for all students, using a discipline-based education research approach. Data on students were gathered including demographics, curriculum, statistical knowledge, and attitudes towards Data Science. Post-course growth was measured, when available, and compared through formal statistical inference. End-of-course evaluations, with supplemental questions about student learning, were reviewed and will be summarized. Finally, reflections on successes, challenges, and lessons learned will be shared."

The engagement of undergraduate students in research, often and early in their path towards degree completion, has been championed as one of the principal reforms necessary to increase the number of capable professionals in STEM. The benefits attributed to undergraduate research experiences have been reported to disproportionately benefit individuals from groups that have been historically underrepresented in STEM. The IDI-BD2K (Increasing Diversity in Interdisciplinary Big Data to Knowledge) Program funded by the NIH at the XXXXXXwas designed to bridge the increasing digital and data divide at the university. The college’s population is 98% Hispanic, it is one of the top 20 producers of Hispanic PhDs in Science and Engineering and yet there is no formal data science program. There also exists a gender imbalance in computing at the College of Natural Sciences at the XXXX. Over 60% of the undergraduate students in Biology are women. However, the percentage of women in Computer Science hovers around 15%. The IDI-BD2K was created to address these concerns and increase the participation of Hispanics in interdisciplinary computational and quantitative research in XXXX. The Interdisciplinary and Quantitative Biology Research Experience for Undergraduates (IQ-Bio-REU) summer program forked off from the IDI-BD2K and was created to engage ten (10) underrepresented undergraduate students from the US and its territories in authentic research experiences in emerging fields of biology which integrate quantitative and computational approaches to projects ranging from molecular biosciences to bioinformatics to ecology to bridge the digital and data divide for Hispanics and women in computing. This paper documents the additions to curriculum as a result of the IDI-BD2K, the first summer of the IQ-Bio-REU and highlights the importance of mutually beneficial collaborations with top research institutions to make it possible.

Statistics and data science practitioners and their educators can achieve and enable greater impact by learning how to create shared understanding with their collaborators as well as teaching this concept to their students, colleagues, and mentees. In this article, we explore and explain the concepts of common knowledge and shared understanding, which is the basis for action to accomplish greater impacts. We also explore related concepts of misunderstanding and doubtful understanding. We describe a process for teaching oneself and others how to create shared understanding. We conclude that incorporating the concept of shared understanding into one’s practice of statistics or data science and following the steps described will result in having more impact on projects and throughout one’s career."

While reproducibility is core to our deﬁnition, most data science learners enter the ﬁeld with other aspects of data science in mind, for example predictive modelling, which is often one of the most interesting topic to novices. This fact, along with the highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools currently employed in data science, present out-of-the gate challenges in teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and workﬂows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction and lots of practice are key to eﬀectively teaching this challenging, yet important subject.

George Cobb offers a metaphor from California real estate, namely that serviceable properties are often rebuilt by their owners to bring them up to date. However, I fear that he has mapped out the most positive scenario for the future of statistics. A “middle ground” metaphor is that of Indian tribes being moved from their reservations to less desirable and less fertile ground—here, statisticians being displaced by data scientists from their sacred territory; a darker metaphor is the fate of the Indian tribes in California in the Mission and post-Mission eras—condemned to servitude, and random acts of genocide. Data cowboys are unlikely to shoot statisticians— but then they don’t need to, because they seem to take over core territory, with rather little effort. Data science is seen to be sexy; it uses data that everyone actually generates (twitter streams, purchasing data, mobile phone locations), and creates applications that are really useful and part of everyday life in developed countries—fingerprint access, speech recognition, weather forecasts, shopping and vacation advice. So there is an existential crisis for statistics—if you can ride the data revolution, who needs a statistician? Well, some statisticians think you do. “Most real life statistical problems have one or more nonstandard features. There are no routine statistical questions; only questionable statistical routines” (Cox, quoted in Chatfield, 1991, p. 240). “All models are wrong, but some are useful” (Box and Draper, 1987, p. 424). Statistics has its origins in solving novel, practical problems. Both the Royal Statistical Society and the American Statistical Association were established by heterogeneous collections of individuals united by a common goal to tackle exciting problems by inventing methods and mathematics (see Pullinger, 2014). A problem for statistics education is that the curriculum devotes too much time to modeling well-understood problems with traditional (1920s) methods, and too little time modeling unfamiliar ones—thereby ignoring the raison d’etre of the discipline. Here, I consider introductory statistics courses. Many introductory courses focus on oneand two-variable problems, work with small samples, and use made-up data. This runs real risks, pedagogically, namely reinforcing the common notion that every sample is representative of the population from which it is drawn, and that small samples are as representative as large ones (i.e. Tversky and Kahneman’s (1974) “representativeness” heuristic). Starting from oneand two-sample problems makes the leap to understanding multivariate data, and no-"

Changes in thecurriculum to cope with changing technologies or industries are leading todemands for enhancement of teachers’ capacity. Accordingly, this study wasconducted with an aim of developing a curriculum to strengthen teachers'AI-related fusion capabilities so that they can adapt to the curriculum when itis revised. To achieve this goal, we analyzed the AI-related curriculum of 18universities in and outside Korea. Based on the results, an AI convergencecurriculum was developed for elementary and secondary school teachers. AnAI convergence curriculum for graduate schools of education for elementaryand secondary teachers was developed, which covers 28 subjects in 6 areas. Inaddition to the essential areas, it includes six other areas: AI educationmethodology, software introduction, programming for artificial intelligence,data science and machine learning, and AI and education. Each area consists of3 to 8 subjects."

These courses often involve a mix of programming and statistics and are taught by instructors from diverse backgrounds. In our experiences launching a data science program at a large public U.S. university over the past four years, we noticed one central tension within many such courses: instructors must finely balance how much computing versus statistics to teach in the limited available time. In this experience report, we provide a detailed firsthand reflection on how we have personally balanced these two major topic areas within several offerings of a large introductory data science course that we taught and wrote an accompanying textbook for; our course has served several thousand students over the past four years. We present three case studies from our experiences to illustrate how computer science and statistics instructors approach data science differently on topics ranging from algorithmic depth to modeling to data acquisition. We then draw connections to deeper tradeoffs in data science to help guide instructors who design interdisciplinary courses. We conclude by suggesting ways that instructors can incorporate both computer science and statistics perspectives to improve data science teaching."
6849f52afc8b1d5a136914347a68f269299aabda,reconciling the promise and pragmatics of enhancing computing pedagogy with data science,"Data science keeps growing in popularity as an introductory computing experience, in which students answer real-world questions by processing data. Armed with carefully prepared pedagogical datasets, computing educators can contextualize assignments and projects in societally meaningful ways, thereby benefiting students' long-term professional careers. However, integrating data science into introductory computing courses requires that the datasets be sufficiently complex, follow appropriate organizational structure, and possess ample documentation. Moreover, the impact of a data science context on students' motivation remains poorly understood. To address these issues, we have created an open-sourced manual for developing pedagogical datasets (freely available at https://think.cs.vt.edu/pragmatics). Structured as a collection of patterns, this manual shares the expertise that we have gained over the last several years, collecting and curating a large collection of real-world datasets, used in a dozen of universities worldwide. We also present new evidence confirming the efficacy of integrating data science in an introductory computing course. As a significant extension of our ongoing work, this study not only validates existing positive assessment, but also provides fine-grained nuance to the potential of data science as a motivational educational element."

However, most smaller schools are currently facing challenges to provide related knowledge and skill to a broad student population. During Spring of 2019, we organized a faculty workshop on ""Data Science Pedagogy and Practice"" aimed at building and enhancing data science capacity (teaching, research, partnership, collaboration) at our institution. We gathered faculty input on what would be needed for a successful university-wide initiative to incorporate data analytics concepts as a basic component of training across variety of disciplines including science, business and social sciences. We were able to identify certain challenges and opportunities to accommodate deeper coverage of data science in the undergraduate teaching and research, and as a result, we initiated few efforts such as 1) teaching through faculty partnership, 2) module-based integration into existing courses rather than developing new courses, 3) development of reusable course modules and augment that with contextual hand-on projects so that students could appreciate the use of data science in their own career path, 4) facilitation of course preparation and implementation via a small faculty adopter grant, and 5) development of a graduate certificate program in data analytics. In this poster, we report our experience in organizing and implementing the workshop, the key aspects of the university-wide data science efforts initiated as a result of the workshop, and the lessons learned so far from these initiatives."
06ca26fe92ead36a1e829e00c845c2492c784b40,introducing data science techniques by connecting database concepts and dplyr,"Abstract Early exposure to data science skills, such as relational databases, is essential for students in statistics as well as many other disciplines in an increasingly data driven society. The goal of the presented pedagogy is to introduce undergraduate students to fundamental database concepts and to illuminate the connection between these database concepts and the functionality provided by the dplyr package for R. Specifically, students are introduced to relational database concepts using visualizations that are specifically designed for students with no data science or computing background. These educational tools, which are freely available on the Web, engage students in the learning process through a dynamic presentation that gently introduces relational databases and how to ask questions of data stored in a relational database. The visualizations are specifically designed for self-study by students, including a formative self-assessment feature. Students are then assigned a corresponding statistics lesson to utilize statistical software in R within the dplyr framework and to emphasize the need for these database skills. This article describes a pilot experience of introducing this pedagogy into a calculus-based introductory statistics course for mathematics and statistics majors, and provides a brief evaluation of the student perspective of the experience. Supplementary materials for this article are available online."
bfd6caddec8a98d531ee9f1f7ebf5833797cd5e3,introducing data science to school kids,"Data-driven decision making is fast becoming a necessary skill in jobs across the board. The industry today uses analytics and machine learning to get useful insights from a wealth of digital information in order to make decisions. With data science becoming an important skill needed in varying degrees of complexity by the workforce of the near future, we felt the need to expose school-goers to its power through a hands-on exercise. We organized a half-day long data science tutorial for kids in grades 5 through 9 (10-15 years old). Our aim was to expose them to the full cycle of a typical supervised learning approach - data collection, data entry, data visualization, feature engineering, model building, model testing and data permissions. We discuss herein the design choices made while developing the dataset, the method and the pedagogy for the tutorial. These choices aimed to maximize student engagement while ensuring minimal pre-requisite knowledge. This was a challenging task given that we limited the pre-requisites for the kids to the knowledge of counting, addition, percentages, comparisons and a basic exposure to operating computers. By designing an exercise with the stated principles, we were able to provide to kids an exciting, hands-on introduction to data science, as confirmed by their experiences. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the tutorial was the first of its kind. Considering the positive reception of such a tutorial, we hope that educators across the world are encouraged to introduce data science in their respective curricula for high-schoolers and are able to use the principles laid out in this work to build full-fledged courses."

In this paper, we present our interdisciplinary approach and experiences in teaching a Data Science course, the first of its kind offered at the Wright State University. Two faculty members from the Management Information Systems (MIS) and Computer Science (CS) departments designed and co-taught the course with perspectives from their previous research and teaching experiences. Students in the class had mix backgrounds with mainly MIS and CS majors. Students' learning outcomes and post course survey responses suggested that the course delivered a broad overview of data science as desired, and that students worked synergistically with those of different majors in collaborative lab assignments and in a semester long project. The interdisciplinary pedagogy helped build collaboration and create satisfaction among learners."
7ea831f1d8a24eb35bcb42a2f12f3c60320d950f,a course on geographic data science,"Data Science (Donoho, 2017) has become one of the most demanded skills thanks to an explosion in the availability of data (Kitchin, 2014). Most of these new sources are, directly or indirecly, geographic in that they can be related to a particular location on a map. However, the vast majority of data science resources available currently ignore the spatial dimension of data, particularly when it comes to the more analytic set of methods covered. At the same time, traditional resources for teaching the handling, visualisation, and analysis of geographic data are based on a paradigm that emphasises graphical interfaces and “point-and-click” software packages. This approach, although valid, limits the flexiblity with which the analyst can effectively move from data to insights, and is more difficult to connect with and benefit from modern advances in both data tools and workflows. This paper presents a pedagogical bridge between the “spatially unaware” set of practices emerging from Data Science, and more traditional resources designed to teach spatial analysis within a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment."

This article conceptualises educational data science as a biopolitical strategy focused on the evaluation and management of the corporeal, emotional and embrained lives of children. Such strategies are enacted through the development of new kinds of digitally-mediated ‘biopedagogies’ of body optimisation, ‘psychopedagogies’ of emotional maximisation, and ‘neuropedagogies’ of brain empowerment. The data practices, scientific knowledges, digital devices and pedagogies that constitute educational data science produce new systems of knowledge about the child that are consequential to their formation as ‘biodigital’ subjects, whose assumed qualities and capacities are defined through expert practices of biosensing, emotion analytics, and neurocomputation, combined with associated scientific knowledges. The article develops the concept of transcoding to account for the processes involved in the formation of the biodigital child."

This study proposes the use of the PHP programming language (technological knowledge), the topics of Normal Distribution (content knowledge) and computer simulation (pedagogical knowledge) to create the Web Application on the Educational Process of Statistics (WAEPS). The sample consists of 61 students who took the subject Statistical Instrumentation for Business during the 2018 school year. The results of the linear regression (machine learning with 50% and 70% of training) indicate that the WAEPS facilitates the educational process on statistics. In fact, the WAEPS promotes the active role in the student, develops mathematical skills and facilitates the assimilation of knowledge about the calculation of upper and lower limits in the Normal Distribution by means of data simulation, interactivity and navigation. Even students consider that this web application is innovative and useful for the educational field. In addition, data science (decision tree technique) identifies various predictive models on the impact of the WAEPS in the educational process. Finally, the TPACK model is an ideal frame of reference to innovate the teaching–learning process through technological, pedagogical and content knowledge."

In the UK, capturing detailed data about students has become a government priority, with an emphasis on using student data to measure, compare and assess university performance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the governmental and commercial drivers of current large‐scale technological efforts to collect and analyse student data in UK HE. The result is an expanding data infrastructure which includes large‐scale and longitudinal datasets, learning analytics services, student apps, data dashboards and digital learning platforms powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Education data scientists have built positive pedagogic cases for student data analysis, learning analytics and AI. The politicization and commercialization of the wider HE data infrastructure is translating them into performance metrics in an increasingly market‐driven sector, raising the need for policy frameworks for ethical, pedagogically valuable uses of student data in HE. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Learning analytics, education data science and artificial intelligence are opening up new ways of collecting and analysing student data in higher education.UK government policies emphasize the use of student data for improvements to teaching and learning.What this paper adds A conceptual framework from ""infrastructure studies"" demonstrates how political objectives and commercial aims are fused to HE data systems, with data infrastructure becoming a key tool of government reform.A critical infrastructure analysis shows that student data processing technologies are being developed and deployed to measure university performance through student data.Implications for practice and/or policy Educators and managers in universities need to prepare robust institutional frameworks to govern their use of student data.Learning analytics practitioners, data scientists, learning scientists and social science researchers need to collaborate with the policy community and education technology developers on new policy frameworks to challenge narrow uses of student data as performance metrics.

The sample consists of 45 students who studied the Basic Math course at a Mexican university during the 2015 school year. The TPACK model allows the planning and organization of WALF through technological knowledge (HTML and PHP languages), content knowledge (formulas on the linear function and slope) and pedagogical knowledge (data simulation). The results of machine learning (linear regression) with 50%, 60% and 70% of training indicate that the contents of WALF influence the assimilation of knowledge about the identification and evaluation of the linear function. Data science identifies 2 predictive models on the use of WALF in the field of mathematics by means of the decision tree technique. Finally, the TPACK model facilitates the implementation of technological tools and construction of educational virtual spaces through technological, content and pedagogical knowledge."

The analysis of long‐term and high‐frequency sensor data combined with simulation modeling enables interpretation of complex ecological phenomena, and the computational skills needed to conduct these analyses are increasingly being integrated into graduate student training programs in ecology. Despite its importance, however, computational literacy—that is, the ability to harness the power of computer technologies to accomplish tasks—is rarely taught in undergraduate ecology classrooms, representing a major gap in training students to tackle complex environmental challenges. Through our experience developing undergraduate curricula in long‐term and high‐frequency data analysis and simulation modeling for two environmental science pedagogical initiatives, Project EDDIE (Environmental Data‐Driven Inquiry and Exploration) and Macrosystems EDDIE, we have found that students often feel intimidated by computational tasks, which is compounded by the lack of familiarity with software (e.g., R) and the steep learning curves associated with script‐based analytical tools. The use of prepackaged, flexible modules that introduce programming as a mechanism to explore environmental datasets and teach inquiry‐based ecology, such as those developed for Project EDDIE and Macrosystems EDDIE, can significantly increase students’ experience and comfort levels with advanced computational tools. These types of modules in turn provide great potential for empowering students with the computational literacy needed to ask ecological questions and test hypotheses on their own. As continental‐scale sensor observatory networks rapidly expand the availability of long‐term and high‐frequency data, students with the skills to manipulate, visualize, and interpret such data will be well‐prepared for diverse careers in data science, and will help advance the future of open, reproducible science in ecology."

Mathematics teachers play an essential role in ensuring citizens’ statistical and probabilistic literacy. This study aimed at analyzing the pedagogical content knowledge that teachers utilized to teach statistics and probability through considering contextualized situations. In order to accomplish this purpose, fourteen secondary mathematics teachers participated in a formative and evaluative activity that was designed using the transformational professional competence model. During each evaluative phase, a group discussion was conducted. Participants were asked to reflect on their actions when promoting statistical and probabilistic literacy by considering a range of topics (data science, didactic resources, and methodological approaches) that were addressed during the training phase. A mixed, quantitative–qualitative methodological design was used for the data collection and analysis, which involved open-ended, multiple-choice, or scale-type questions that were moderated by the Metaplan® approach and the Mentimeter® software. The main ideas that emerged from the results indicated the need to reinforce the use of real data, technological resources to handle the visualization of information, the elaboration of different types of graphs besides the classical ones, and the formulation of hypotheses. The initial diagnosis will continue within a research and practice community made up of teachers and researchers. Therefore, a working proposal based on examples and models contextualized within the COVID-19 crisis is presented in order to enhance secondary mathematics teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge."

Based on holistic theories of academic motivation, this means making the environment present itself as both interesting and useful, without sacrificing pedagogical power and scaffolding. We present Data Science as a potential context that satisfies all of these constraints, and describe our new block-based programming environment for education that supports data science from day one: BlockPy, available at http://think.cs.vt.edu/blockpy/. BlockPy features a number of powerful, authentic features meant to promote transfer for students to conventional environments as they progress. This includes mutual language translation and interactive feedback, but also powerful tools for getting real-world data and visualizing it. As we have developed the tool, we have identified a number of major research questions that should be answered in order to determine the validity of our hypothesis and the potential of our approach: in particular, how can this environment and context support educators and diverse learners as they progress into conventional environments."

For example, while good-quality education is a well-acknowledged foundation of sustainable development, innovation and creativity, variations in student attainment and general performance remain commonplace. Developing data -driven solutions hinges on two fronts-technical and application. The former relates to the modelling perspective, where two of the major challenges are the impact of data randomness and general variations in definitions, typically referred to as concept drift in machine learning. The latter relates to devising data-driven solutions to address real-life challenges such as identifying potential triggers of pedagogical performance, which aligns with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #4-Quality Education. A total of 3145 pedagogical data points were obtained from the central data collection platform for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Ministry of Education (MoE). Using simple data visualisation and machine learning techniques via a generic algorithm for sampling, measuring and assessing, the paper highlights research pathways for educationists and data scientists to attain unified goals in an interdisciplinary context. Its novelty derives from embedded capacity to address data randomness and concept drift by minimising modelling variations and yielding consistent results across samples. Results show that intricate relationships among data attributes describe the invariant conditions that practitioners in the two overlapping fields of data science and education must identify."

We consider the current relevance of several of these lessons and whether we have learned from them. Many national reports have been published about teaching statistics with few of their recommendations being implemented. There have been rapid developments in the methodology of, and technology used by, statistics at all levels outside schools. These have led to the accelerated development of the use of statistics and related disciplines such as data science (DS). In schools, we have not seen as much progress in teaching, learning, assessing, or communicating these subjects. We consider reasons for lack of progress in pedagogy and make our own recommendations to get schools to catch up with the exciting developments in the practice and communication of statistics and DS."

d2f9a80f5bf63363ec29ad291715fe79c40cd7c7,mentor academy engaging global learners in the creation of data science problems for moocs,"We engaged MOOC learners (mentors; n=120) as collaborators in the design and improvement of an online course through an activity called the Mentor Academy; an online instructional program where mentors create original problem sets for future iterations of a course. Following a design research methodology, we trace the development of the program’s design and report on the features of a learning design that effectively support mentors in the problem creation process. Our analysis shows that mentors were offered three kinds of support: community building, logistical, and pedagogical. The following kinds of changes and additions were made to the design: expanded project requirements, improved technical infrastructure, and increased opportunities for interaction in discussion forums and live peer chat sessions. We present an analysis of problem sets for quality, diversity of subject area, and usability. Introduction and theoretical foundations Instructors and designers of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) face a two-fold challenge in creating content for a global audience of learners: (1) it is time consuming to develop robust problems for learners who require multiple opportunities to practice emerging skills; (2) problems should be representative of learners who are situated in diverse contexts. The first challenge is a logistical and pedagogical one; the second challenge relates to the growing worry that MOOCs currently promote a version of cultural hegemony (Head, 2017). To address both of these challenges we designed the Mentor Academy, a two-week instructional program that invited learners who successfully completed the University of Michigan’s Introduction to Data Science in Python MOOC to be mentors and engage in the creation of problems for use by new learners in the next iteration of the MOOC. Our work builds on the concept of learnersourcing as a method of engaging with learners to create new learning experiences (Kim, 2015). Learnersourcing “is a form of crowdsourcing in which learners collectively contribute novel content for future learners, while engaging in meaningful learning experiences themselves” (Kim, 2015, p 3). We asked mentors to identify and then use subject matter and datasets that they felt would be compelling and relevant for learners who live and work in the same local context (i.e., country). Our program resulted in both a more plentiful and a more diverse set of problems than the instructional team would be able to provide on their own. Our approach also shares common ideas with communities of practice, where members are mutually engaged in a joint enterprise, and work with a shared repertoire while actively negotiating the nature of the enterprise (Lave & Wenger, 1998). It also shares commonalities associated with cognitive apprenticeship, a model that adapts apprenticeship methods for the teaching and learning of cognitive skills (Collins, 2006). Tasks are situated in authentic contexts, and are “tightly coupled to the underlying competencies needed to carry out the tasks” (Collins, 2006, p. 54). In the Mentor Academy, mentors were apprentice instructors, acquiring the skills and competencies required to create problems suitable for use by novices in the domain of data science. These skills were modelled by the instructors of the program. The mentors’ work was situated in an authentic context, that of an existing MOOC, and their contributions were seen as essential for the betterment of the MOOC. The following research questions guided our investigation: 1. What features of the learning design effectively support mentors in the creation of problem sets for use in the next-iteration of an online data science course? 2. What are the outcomes of the Mentor Academy program with respect to problem creation? Methodology and research design We recruited 120 mentors from the following countries: United States, India, Canada, China, Germany, and Brazil. We hosted Mentor Academy as four private courses on Coursera, one of the largest MOOC platforms. Instructors prepared video lectures that targeted pedagogical concepts such as constructivism, scaffolding, and writing effective problems. During each two-week session, approximately 30 mentors were asked to locate local data sets and write problems that leveraged those datasets. The problems were written in the Python programming ICLS 2018 Proceedings 1415 © ISLS language, using the Jupyter notebook environment. Mentors shared their problems on discussion boards and in synchronous video conferences with instructors and other mentors. We used an iterative design research methodology in which two-week sessions overlapped by one week to allow for rapid iteration from one design cycle to the next. Transcriptions of design debrief sessions with course instructors and the research team and design documentation (e.g., annotated wireframes, digital spreadsheets) were analyzed to understand (1) effective program supports and (2) improvement strategies. We analyzed the 39 problems that resulted from the four Mentor Academy sessions with respect to quality, diversity of subject area, and usability. Results and discussion Features of learning design that were effective in supporting mentors Our analysis revealed (a) three types of supports that were effective in supporting mentors and (b) five improvement strategies. Types of supports included: (i) community building (i.e., opportunities for mentors to interact with instructors and peers), (ii) logistical support (i.e., videos and documentation that explain the mechanics of the platform and organization of the program), and (iii) pedagogical support (i.e., instruction about pedagogy and feedback on problems). Improvement strategies included: (i) expanded project requirements, (ii) improved technical infrastructure, and (iii) increased opportunities for interaction with instructors in discussion forums and live peer chat sessions. Expanded project requirements and improved technical infrastructure led to increased diversity among problems; we allowed non-Wikipedia data sets to be used (e.g., local government data) and added technical capacity by allowing mentors to use URLs that contained accents. We gave mentors opportunities to share datasets and problems with instructors and peers in week one of the program, created additional opportunities for synchronous feedback, and provided mentors with improved scripts for video conferences with that included only mentors (not instructors). Outcomes of the Mentor Academy program with respect to problem creation Our analysis of problems with respect to quality revealed that generally problems stated a clear goal as well as details relating to product/performance that were required to solve the problem. However, problems often lacked supporting details and sufficient context that would motivate learners to solve the problem. Future versions of the Mentor Academy will consider how instructional resources can target this aspect of problem creation. Our analysis of problems with respect to diversity uncovered four general topic areas: (1) society (e.g., immigration, population trends, child mortality reduction); (2) economics (e.g., government budget distribution, automobile industry); (3) individual in society (e.g., sports, healthcare, transportation); and (4) environment (e.g., air pollution, deforestation, and natural disasters). Some problems related to temporally relevant topics (e.g., hurricanes and California wildfires). We intend to perform a more nuanced analysis of these problems to understand the extent to which problems are relevant to learners from specific geographic regions. Our analysis of problems with respect to usability uncovered four problem types, with respect to size: • Micro (n=8): Small questions which could be completed quickly with one or two lines of code, suitable for use within an “in-video” quiz (i.e., embedded within a lecture, executable within the video player); • Meso (n=11): The intended question size for the Mentor Academy program, which tended to be between 5-15 lines of code and practiced a single skill or topic; • Macro (n=19): A series of questions which built on one another, suitable for use as an assignment; • Tutorial (n=1): A form of worked example which provides a descriptive analysis, showing insights gleaned through data analysis in a narrative form, and which is intended to be read (and perhaps replicated) by the learner, but is not a problem to solve per se. These problems will be integrated in the next iteration of the Introduction to Data Science in Python MOOC."

Most traditional pedagogies offer students limited timely feedback, require lecturers and teachers to spend hours grading routine assignments. These pedagogies fail in integrating ample digital resources and are not potent to enhance students’ understanding. Data has enormous potential to enhance research, decision making, and lifelong learning. The combination of complex disciplines of computer science and statistics with social science philosophy in education data science aims to study more about how students learn and interact in the educational environment with real-time data collection. Despite its infancy, the wide availability of educational data has spurred an interest in analyzing relevant knowledge to guide educational policy and practice. This paper discusses the applications of data science in education field as well as the challenges for future development."

Yet, educational materials and methodologies on this important subject still lack. In this paper, I will recount my experience in developing, teaching, and refining a technical course called “Responsible Data Science”, which tackles the issues of ethics in AI, legal compliance, data quality, algorithmic fairness and diversity, transparency of data and algorithms, privacy, and data protection. I will also describe a public education course called “We are AI: Taking Control of Technology” that brings these topics of AI ethics to the general audience in a peer-learning setting.

4872f3b6bdb12ec8e78bc6d06257849ef9069d5d,technology laboratories facilitating instruction for cyberinfrastructure infused data sciences,"While artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) frameworks gain prominence in science and engineering, most researchers face significant challenges in adopting complex AI/ML workflows to campus and national cyberinfrastructure (CI) environments. Data from the Texas A&M High Performance Computing (HPRC) researcher training program indicate that researchers increasingly want to learn how to migrate and work with their pre-existing AI/ML frameworks on large scale computing environments. Building on the continuing success of our work in developing innovative pedagogical approaches for CI-training approaches, we expand CI-infused pedagogical approaches to teach technology-based AI and data sciences. We revisit the pedagogical approaches used in the decades-old tradition of laboratories in the Physical Sciences that taught concepts via experiential learning. Here, we structure a series of exercises on interactive computing environments that give researchers immediate hands-on experience in AI/ML and data science technologies that they will use as they work on larger CI resources. These exercises, called “tech-labs,” assume that participating researchers are familiar with AI/ML approaches and focus on hands-on exercises that teach researchers how to use these approaches on large-scale CI. The tech-labs offer four consecutive sessions, each introducing a learner to specific technologies offered in CI environments for AI/ML and data workflows. We report on our tech-lab offered for Python-based AI/ML approaches during which learners are introduced to Jupyter Notebooks followed by exercises using Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Keras. The program includes a series of enhancements such as container support and easy launch of virtual environments in our Web-based computing interface. The approach is scalable to programs using a command line interface (CLI) as well. In all, the program offers a shift in focus from teaching AI/ML toward increasing adoption of AI/ML in large-scale CI."

There is a great variety of programs that address the teaching of this field with a growing demand of professionals. However, data science pedagogy tends to emphasize general aspects of data and the use of tools instead of the its scientific dimension. This position paper describes an ongoing educational innovation project for the use of the Challenge-based Learning approach to teach and learn Data Science. In this approach, students work on solving complex and real world problems while the learning is obtained by iterating through three main phases: engage, investigate, and act."
ca4619b6fac733906311fd3a6a7a664ce049f022,crossdisciplinary faculty development in data science principles for classroom integration,"Data science in practice leverages the expertise in computer science, mathematics and statistics with applications in any field using data. The formalization of data science educational and pedagogical strategic remain in their infancy. College faculty from various disciplines are tasked with designing and delivering data science instruction without the formal knowledge of how data science principles are executed in practice. We call this the data science instruction gap. Also, these faculties are implementing their discipline's standard pedagogical strategies to their understanding of data science. In this paper, we present our cross-disciplinary instructional program model designed to narrow the data science instruction gap for faculty. It is designed to scaffold college faculties' data science learning to support their discipline-specific data science instruction. We provide individualized and group-based support structures to instill data science principles and transition them from learners to educators in data science. Lastly, we share our model's impact on and value to faculty as well as make recommendations for model adoption."

Growing data bandwidth coupled with amplified computational resources are aligning to allow for analysis of human behaviors at unprecedented scales. The proper data generation, collection, storage and analysis techniques are mostly untaught in the undergraduate experience. Pedagogical research shows that project based learning encourages and supports design thinking and collaborative work; skills that are important to practitioners in data science centric industries. To address these academic needs, we develop the Evergreen Learning Platform (EvergreenLP). EvergreenLP is an interdisciplinary project based learning framework that leverages pedagogy rooted in Critical Media Literacy. Students take advantage of design-learning principles on the front-end and computational discipline standards on the back end. Students are engaged in the design, development and use of this platform while simultaneously contributing data content on the chosen social media platform. Our data analysis and visualization environment allows the student coders and non-coders to explore data science principles in context of a current event or topic trending on twitter. In this paper, we experimentally assess and present the benefits of introducing culturally relevant data techniques to African-American female students in an interdisciplinary seminar on #BlackGirlMagic (#BGM)."
55ad5e818cfed72317576027fb33a9609210d592,training and evaluating a jupyter notebook data science assistant,"We study the feasibility of a Data Science assistant powered by a sequence-to-sequence transformer by training a new model JuPyT5 on all publicly available Jupyter Notebook GitHub repositories and developing a new metric: Data Science Problems (DSP). DSP is a collection of 1119 problems curated from 306 pedagogical notebooks with 92 dataset dependencies, natural language and Markdown problem descriptions, and assert-based unit tests. These notebooks were designed to test university students’ mastery of various Python implementations of Math and Data Science, and we now leverage them to study the ability of JuPyT5 to understand and pass the tests. We analyze the content of DSP, validate its quality, and we find that given 100 sampling attempts JuPyT5 is able to solve 77.5% of the DSP problems. We further present various ablation and statistical analyses and compare DSP to other recent natural language to code benchmarks. One focus of machine learning research is to build intelligent assistants which can fill-in or predict information based on a context provided by a user. These agents can be as simple as next-word or phrase prediction like in GMail Smart Compose (Chen et al. 2019) or as complex as conversational agents based on language models like GPT-3 (Brown et al. 2020). Much work has been done to use these agents to solve natural language tasks, and more recently, to solve software engineering tasks. For example Svyatkovskiy et al. (2020) offers line-completion to a user and the Codex model (Chen et al. 2021) offers complete methods and classes. While these works evaluate general-purpose coding, there is an opportunity to focus on an agent which offers suggestions in a pedagogical environment: can we develop an agent which can offer students suggestions to solve problems in data science via Jupyter notebooks? Large language models (Radford et al. 2018) and transformers (Lewis et al. 2019) have unlocked consistent improvements (Kaplan et al. 2020; Brown et al. 2020) in natural language processing and more recently in code synthesis from natural language and examples (Chen et al. 2021; Austin et al. 2021; Clement et al. 2020), code completion (Svyatkovskiy et al. 2020, 2019; Raychev, Vechev, and Yahav 2014; Bruch, Monperrus, and Mezini 2009), code search (Husain et al. 2019; Feng et al. 2020), bug fixing (Drain et al. 2021) and Copyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. detection (Zhai et al. 2020), unit test generation (Tufano et al. 2020), and many other applications. Extending the evaluation of these transformers beyond traditional NLP metrics like BLEU/ROUGE scores, Chen et al. (2021) and Austin et al. (2021) introduced HumanEval and Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP), respectively, which are sets of natural language descriptions of programs along with unit tests and ground truth Python implementations. By compiling and executing generated hypotheses for these Python programs, these works established generally that larger models solve more problems and that drawing more samples (giving the models more attempts) can solve more problems. Further, Austin et al. (2021) showed that human-in-the-loop feedback with model hypotheses could help the model overcome incorrect solutions. Both works observed generally that models struggled to compose descriptions of multiple chained operations. Figure 1: An example (top) from Data Science Problems which loads a file and suggests a data-cleaning modification of the Pandas dataframe, where a solution is to be inserted between the prompt cell and assert-laden grading cell. Given the prompt and context, our model JuPyT5 correctly interprets and implements this code (bottom). Inspired by these evaluations of natural language modeling 1 ar X iv :2 20 1. 12 90 1v 1 [ cs .L G ] 3 0 Ja n 20 22 of source code, this paper introduces an executable Jupyter notebook metric which tests a models ability to solve data science and college-level Computer Science problems. Jupyter notebooks are hybrid code and documentation environments, organized by cells, containing rich Markdown cells, presentation cells, code cells, and output cells. Jupyter notebooks are used widely in both education and business, promoting easily shareable self-documented code in one user experience. As such, Jupyter notebooks are an important environment to test the efficacy of code generation and program language understanding. This paper offers the following contributions: 1. We introduce a new evaluation called Data Science Problems (DSP)1, a curated set of pedagogical Python notebooks and data contexts containing rich Markdown descriptions of problems, solutions, and unit tests, which uses the teaching tool nbgrader2 to automatically evaluate model hypotheses. DSP problem descriptions also contains natural language with unit tests, featuring LTEX and math, data-dependencies, and implicit dependencies between the problems in a single notebook. 2. We introduce a new ’code-infilling’ pre-training objective, similar to span-mask pre-training and the method-featurefilling objective of PyMT5 (Clement et al. 2020), wherein each cell in each notebook is considered a target in one example, and the source is the neighboring cells with a control code indicating which cell type to produce and where it should be inserted. The resulting model trained by this objective is called JuPyT5 – Jupyter Python Textto-text Transfer Transformer. 3. While we do not follow the trend of exploring model size, we focus on evaluating a model size with more modest deployment cost by training and evaluating one model size of 350M parameters (300M non-embedding parameters). We evaluate this model size trained on the cell-infilling objective for our new DSP metric, showing it can solve 78% of the DSP tasks given 100 sampled attempts. We find similarly that model performance improves with larger number of samples, and more context cells improves the model performance. Surprisingly, training the model with the ability to look ahead a single cell doubles the performance on DSP compared to a 3-cell look-back baseline. Showing the model unit tests also improves performance, and interestingly, the model learns to adapt the solutions to previous problems on a subsequent problem. 4. We also evaluate JuPyT5 on HumanEval and MBPP. JuPyT5 can beat a much larger 68B parameter model at MBPP with a modest 300M parameters, but was also explicitly trained only on code domain sources. While large models are very impressive general-learners from diverse data sources, it is still much more economical to focus a model training on a task domain. JuPyT5 was outperformed by a similar-sized Codex model on HumanEval, but we were able to partially close the gap by adapting HumanEval docstrings to look more like Markdown. We conclude naturally that smaller models are more formatting-sensitive. github.com/microsoft/DataScienceProblems https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ 5. We evaluate our model trained on all naturally occurring types of Jupyter notebooks on GitHub, and also on a model trained on a subset of the notebooks containing large amounts of Markdown cells, showing improvement on DSP by balancing the training data to contain similar amounts of code and Markdown. Data Science Problems are inspired by several existing code execution evaluations in the literature. The first is the APPS dataset (Hendrycks et al. 2021), a collection of 10,000 problems from code competitions. We did not evaluate on this evaluation as we were interested in more task-grounded domains. The second is HumanEval, introduced with the codefine-tuned GPT-3 model Codex (Chen et al. 2021), which features Python signatures containing doctest unit tests and natural language docstring descriptions of problems to be solve. The third is Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP), which are natural language descriptions of problems along with assert-based unit tests. HumanEval and MBPP are more similar to our new DSP metric, but differ a lot in the task domain. DSP is task-grounded as 35% of its problems explicitly depend on a data context. Further, DSP is an educational domain, so can evaluate the ability of a model to potentially assist in student coaching or continued data science education in business environments. DSP is also larger than HumanEval and MBPP, with over 1000 problem-test pairs, and can test the ability of a model to understand sequences of tasks in context with one another. Figure 2: An example (top) from Data Science Problems describing an implementation of a log-Bernoulli loss function using LTEX. Our model JuPyT5 correctly interprets the LTEX definition of the loss as using torch and even names the function and arguments as described in the prompt."

Training resources often deprecate because their maintenance is not prioritized by funding, giving teams little time to devote to such endeavors. Our group has developed Open-source Tools for Training Resources (OTTR) to offer greater efficiency and flexibility for creating and maintaining online course content. OTTR empowers creators to customize their work and allows for a simple workflow to publish using multiple platforms. OTTR allows content creators to publish material to multiple massive online learner communities using familiar rendering mechanics. OTTR allows the incorporation of pedagogical practices like formative and summative assessments in the form of multiple choice questions and fill in the blank problems that are automatically graded. No local installation of any software is required to begin creating content with OTTR. Thus far, 15 courses have been created with OTTR repository template. By using the OTTR system, the maintenance workload for updating these courses across platforms has been drastically reduced."

Shortly after the American Society of Animal Science (ASAS) centennial, we conducted a national survey of 90 faculty instructors from 49 academic institutions to assess their perceptions of emerging teaching topics. Participants rated 18 learning outcomes (LO) and 16 types of courses and experiences (CE) with respect to their importance and the adequacy of available offerings. This study presents the results of the survey along with a scoping review of animal sciences teaching and learning publications since 2008 (n = 71). Results indicated that discipline-specific competencies and core experiential learning remain central to animal sciences teaching and identified several distinct needs for research. Namely, we suggest that future research in animal sciences teaching and learning 1) develop animal-science-specific expertise on a greater variety of pedagogies, 2) validate improved methods for assessing transferable skills, 3) expand pedagogical knowledge of emerging topics (e.g., sustainability, data science, welfare science, social science), and 4) deepen and broaden animal sciences’ teaching and learning identity through theory-building work and collaborations across instructors, disciplines, and institutions."
4688c0d348027e0ceabe613b578983ba0c4021c1,accurate measurement of lexical sophistication with reference to esl learner data,"One commonly used measure of lexical sophistication is the Advanced Guiraud (AG; [9]), whose formula requires frequency band counts (e.g., COCA; [13]). However, the accuracy of this measure is affected by the particular 2000-word frequency list selected as the basis for its calculations [27]. For example, possible issues arise when frequency lists that are based solely on native speaker corpora are used as a target for second language (L2) learners (e.g., [8]) because the exposure frequencies for L2 learners may vary from that of native speakers. Such L2 variation from comparable native speakers may be due to first language (L1) culture, home country teaching materials, or the text types which L2 learners commonly encounter. This paper addresses the aforementioned problem through an English as a Second Language (ESL) frequency list validation. Our validation is established on two sources: (1) the New General Service List (NGSL; [4]) which is based on the Cambridge English Corpus (CEC) and (2) written data from the 4.2 million-word Pitt English Language Institute Corpus (PELIC). Using open-source data science tools and natural language processing technologies, the paper demonstrates that more distinct measurable lexical sophistication differences across levels are discernible when learner-oriented frequency lists (as compared to general corpora frequency lists) are used as part of a lexical measure such as AG. The results from this research will be useful in teaching contexts where lexical proficiency is measured or assessed, and for materials and test developers who rely on such lists as being representative of known vocabulary at different levels of proficiency. This research applies data-driven exploration of learner corpora to vocabulary acquisition and pedagogy, thus closing a loop between educational data mining and classroom applications."

For a sports coach, deciding the best team composition is crucial to ensure winning. This requires understanding the dynamics of the players and the game parameters. However, small sports communities do not usually have the chance to benefit from this advanced technology. In a Data Mining course at Universiti Putra Malaysia, a data analytic project of basketball players' performance has been conducted through experiential learning approach. This paper presents the experience and output of shooting performance analytic, attack profiling analysis, team performance analysis, player rating prediction and game outcome prediction. The achievements of the students on the project are high with low marks deviation, plus the students said that the pedagogy encourages them to be highly committed and independent. Engaging lessons have also been happening as students compassionately share about their findings."
1b8410cb996b13eb28631c9cf367a20bbc109697,facebook is not a silver bullet for teachers professional development anatomy of an eightyearold socialmedia community,"Online communities and social-network sites are used to deliver professional-development services for teachers. Professional development should help teachers to reflect on their practice and improve in helping them to guide students’ growth. Peer and community models, such as coaching and sharing knowledge in network and knowledge communities, have been proposed. Recently these practices have been taken into use in social media services, such as Facebook. Although earlier research has examined teachers’ online communities, we move beyond understanding individuals motivations and examine community-level dynamics. Understanding these dynamics is important to understand the interaction between teachers, resources and the platform in use and resulting professional development. To understand the evolution of an informal and self-organised Facebook teachers’ group, containing nearly 20,000 teachers, its eight years of activity was analysed by employing a mixed-methods research design; data science and participatory observation. Analysis gives account of both the evolution of participants’ engagement and activity, and the evolution of content and its relevance for teachers’ professional development. The results suggest that managers of professional development need to consider how to facilitate participation in order to focus on pedagogically motivated use of information technology, for system developers to consider how to assist recruitment of members and sustain their activity, and for all stakeholders to acknowledge that a peer-organised online professional development community requires significant effort. Furthermore, we suggest that instead of addressing large groups like these as communities, scholars and practitioners should instead see them as personal learning networks and think about how to establish smaller and more manageable groups as communities."
8b88026ab53de878eb13e114b30512712df8ae71,developing lesson plans for teaching spatial data management in academic libraries through a lens of popular culture,"ABSTRACT Understanding data management in spatial data science is fundamentally important when ensuring a project’s data is appropriately collected, analyzed, stored, and communicated. However, these concepts are often introduced to learners through compliance (i.e., we do this because we are required to or it is the right thing to do), and as a result can mean learning experiences around spatial data management are viewed less than enthusiastically. Academic libraries are places where engaging learning experiences around spatial data management can be explored and implemented through unique pedagogical techniques. For example, activities teaching spatial data management in academic libraries through a popular culture lens can make these topics more approachable and reduce learning barriers. In this paper, I present three lesson plans for academic librarians which approach teaching spatial data management through popular culture. The following concepts are represented: (1) understanding spatial metadata through Dungeons & Dragons; (2) learning to write good documentation through drawing Pokémon; and (3) developing good file naming habits with 1980s album covers. Alongside the lesson plans, I provide a narrative outlining why popular culture pedagogy is a useful technique to spatial data management education to increase the inclusivity and engagement around geospatial learning experiences in academic libraries."
435c72aef6fccdfc24c86a1a1a35c1739ba04d84,the stewardship model an inclusive approach to undergraduate research,"As members of the professorate, we occupy spaces that are rarely diverse, inclusive, or accessible, and current practices for training social science researchers reproduce the status quo. Too few students from diverse backgrounds—notably, first-generation college students and students of color, but also women—enter the training pipeline early in their college career (Schultz et al. 2011). Moreover, those who do enter are disproportionately likely to exit (Monforti and Michelson 2008). These twin institutional failures yield cohorts of newly trained social scientists that are persistently less diverse than they could be. In response, we developed a new model of mentored undergraduate research experiences (UREs)—the Stewardship Model of Mentoring—designed to recruit, train, mentor, and support a diverse new generation of social scientists. We practice the StewardshipModel because none of us could have joined the professorate without substantial investments in our professional development, growth, and success. We recognize that we must be good stewards of these investments by not only multiplying them in the next generation but also dispersing them more widely. This article describes the theory and practice of the Stewardship Model within the Security and Political Economy (SPEC) Lab, a research and mentoring organization at the University of Southern California. Led by three faculty Principal Investigators (PIs) and a graduate student director, the SPEC Lab conducts research on issues at the intersection of climate change, security, and economic development. Our mission is to recruit students from diverse backgrounds, train them in data science and other social science research skills, and support them as they plan for and begin their careers in academia, government, nonprofits, or industry. The SPEC Lab is undergraduate focused, currently serving approximately 40 undergraduate students and a small group of PhD students. The Lab’s faculty and PhD students are political scientists by training; however, our research is interdisciplinary and our undergraduate research assistants and faculty collaborators hail from a range of academic disciplines, including economics, philosophy, computer science, and foreign languages. Although these fields face their own diversity challenges, which we address in part through our work, the Lab’s greatest impact is likely on the international relations (IR) subfield of political science, wherein lies our core expertise. The SPEC Lab is located at a large R1 institution; however, its mission and organizational principles are adaptable to a range of institutional contexts. Key features of the Lab —for example, for-credit research experiences—travel well to teaching-focused institutions and faculty mentors with higher course loads. The pedagogical approach used by the SPEC Lab, which we refer to as the Stewardship Model, is specifically designed to build diversity in the social science talent pipeline. The model combines fivekeyelements: (1) targeted recruitment, (2) technical training, (3) applied research experience, (4) multilevel mentorship, and (5) membership in a carefully constructed learning community. Collectively, these five practices allow us to recruit diverse students whomay not initially consider a career in social science possible, and we provide the tools and support necessary for them to thrive as researchers and professionals. We first describe the principles of the Stewardship Model and its implementation and then discuss strategies for adapting the model to a range of institutional contexts. We also outline an ongoing multi-institutional, mixed-method study of the shortand long-term effects of UREs. We describe steps that faculty members can take to both participate in this study and join a community of faculty working to provide mentored research experiences for their students."
527186fca07c01edcbbc20570088fe435dedd3c3,applying entrepreneurial teaching methods to advanced technical stem courses,"A vast majority of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) courses and pedagogical frameworks concentrate on teaching the fundamental concepts and theoretical underpinnings of the tools related to the subject. While this aspect is important, we recognize that the teaching methods in a majority of the STEM courses today are broken; there is a major discrepancy between the skills and mindsets in technical classes and the ones that are useful to solve actual problems in “the real world”. Therefore, we suggest a new teaching framework called Data-X where entrepreneurial teaching methods developed in the Berkeley Method of Entrepreneurship are applied to advanced technical topics. Through inductive learning and by practicing story creation, stakeholder generation, adaptation, ideation, innovation processes, and by having a diverse mix of students being coached by a network of expert advisors, this highly applied teaching method empowers students to pursue and find solutions to open-ended projects and problems. The Data-X framework has been implemented and tested for three semesters in a UC Berkeley course called Applied Data Science for Venture Applications. In the class the students pick up, become comfortable, and utilize state-of-the-art tools in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. The results, feedback, and testimonials we have received upon offering the class have been overwhelmingly positive, and we propose that the ideas and concepts behind Data-X can help fix many problems in modern STEM education."

However, we believe that some essential protections and procedures should be in place to help prevent misuses of data. In particular, we are writing to you to address our concerns with the article “OkCupid Data for Introductory Statistics and Data Science Courses” by Albert Y. Kim and Adriana Escobedo-Land that was published in your journal (Kim and Escobedo-Land 2015). In light of ethical concerns surrounding the article, herein we describe the background of how the dataset was found to contain identifiable information. We communicated this to the authors, who correspondingly corrected the article. In our opinion, there is no doubt that the dataset presented in the article holds pedagogical value as well as research value. One aspect of the educational value of the dataset is the fact that the context of possible analysis could better drive students’ interests. The research value of the data lies within the self-reported nature of the dataset, which usually is the private property of corporations and could be hard to obtain for researchers in universities. Another context in which the pedagogical value of the dataset remains is where students could use this as a case study in discussions of the ethical implications of such data, even practicing anonymization skills with the data. However, we do believe that for the dataset to be used for pedagogical purposes, further anonymizations to the dataset were necessary. Some ways that datasets like this one could be better anonymized in the future include removing unimportant variables that have identification power disproportionate to their value to research. For example, in the case of the OkCupid dataset associated with the paper, the time the data was collected could be removed, since this fact is not particularly essential but can be used for identification. Other sources of concern for this dataset are the variables that reveal geographical and temporal information on individuals. Another method could"

As part of their pedagogical processes, HDSI faculty desired a way to store and share student capstone projects with future cohorts, so students could easily access reusable, raw datasets and analytical workflows, with the potential to expand on work done by previous cohorts. The UC San Diego Library has been managing an institutional data repository for over a decade, with established ingest workflows and tools. The Library's Digital Collections accommodates collections of objects, complex organization of data and metadata, batch ingest options, and deposit of large datasets. Curators review data submissions and work with data depositors to enrich collections with descriptive metadata, controlled vocabularies, and persistent identifiers. HDSI faculty are working with the Library's Data Science Librarian and members of the Library's Research Data Curation program to design a custom workflow to facilitate ingest of an entire class worth of projects within a relatively quick time frame and have students prepare their materials with minimal one-on-one instruction from Library staff. The first test of this workflow ingests project materials from the Data Science & Engineering Master of Advanced Study capstone course into the Library's digital repository and makes the materials available using community-standard discoverability tools. This process represents the first ingestion of data- and computationally-intensive student projects into the repository and is intended to provide a template for a scalable workflow to accommodate other courses, ultimately creating a series of course data collections to support teaching and learning."

The theme of the issue is the use of advanced technologies for education and training. Specifically, it focuses on the application of data science and machine learning methodologies in all aspects of modern education such as pedagogy management, E-learning, virtual lab management, improving hands-on online teaching methodologies, etc. The key objective is to share and exchange innovative ideas and experiences in modern education with evolving intelligent technologies. Today there are many successful applications of machine learning methodologies for education. A number of papers in this special issue apply machine learningbased models for the semantic annotation of English language educational resources. It creates linear decision-making models with machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to effectively address the issues of present-day E-learning platforms, specifically in the context of English language educational resources. Other papers focus on enhancing teaching and learning methodologies with artificial intelligence techniques. Since E-learning platforms are consid-"

But it is precisely this power that makes it worth asking: ""Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? These are some of the questions that emerge from Data Feminism (D'Ignazio & Klein, MIT Press, 2020), a way of thinking about data science and its communication that is informed by the past several decades of intersectional feminist activism and critical thought. Illustrating data feminism in action, this talk will show how challenges to the male/female binary can help to challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems; it will explain how an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization; how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems; and why the data never, ever ""speak for themselves."" Drawing from data feminism, this talk will focus on implications for teaching and learning. It features examples from the book which connect intersectional feminist theory to data literacy and innovative pedagogy for diverse audiences. This goal of this talk, as with the project of data feminism, is to model how scholarship can be transformed into action: how feminist thinking can be operationalized in order to imagine more ethical and equitable data education practices."

As a valuable 21st century skill, preparing students to be able to divine meaning from data can be useful to their long-term careers. Because Data Science aligns so closely with computing, many of the topics and problems it affords as a context can support the core learning objectives in introductory computing classes. In many instances, incorporating a real-world dataset to provide concrete context for an activity or assignment can improve student engagement and understanding of the abstract educational content being presented. However, there are many problems inherent to bringing real-world data into introductory courses. How do instructors, with finite amounts of time and energy, find and prepare suitable datasets for their pedagogical needs? Once the datasets are ready, how can students conveniently interact with and draw meaning from the datasets, especially when they are used in complex projects that are typical of later introductory courses? On the other hand, how does an instructor balance the complexities of using real-world datasets in the classroom, making sure that students appreciate the meaningfulness of course activities and their connection to learning objectives? This panel brings together experts with experience in using real-world data in introductory computing courses. Each panelist provides unique perspectives and skills to the problem of preparing, interacting, visualizing, and using pedagogical datasets. This panel should be of particular interest to instructors who are considering integrating current and real-world data into their assignments and projects, and to educational developers who want to create and manage datasets for pedagogical purposes. The panel will follow a conventional format: 5 minutes of introduction, 10 minutes for each panelist to present, and then 30 minutes for audience Q&A."

The objective of this mixed research is to analyze the impact of the flipped classroom in the teaching-learning process on statistics considering data science and machine learning (linear regression). The sample consists of 61 students who took the Statistical Instrumentation for Business course during the 2018 school year. This research proposes the consultation of the YouTube videos before the class, performance of the collaborative exercises and use of the spreadsheet to check the results during the class and performance of the laboratory practices through the spreadsheet after the class. The results of machine learning (70%, 80% and 90% of training) indicate that the participation of the students before, during and after the class positively influences the assimilation of knowledge and development of mathematical skills about the frequencies and measures of central tendency. On the other hand, the decision tree technique identifies 6 predictive models on the use of the flipped classroom. Also, the students of the Statistical Instrumentation for Business course are motivated and satisfied to use the technological tools in the Introduction to statistics Unit. Finally, the flipped classroom allows the construction of new educational spaces and creation of creative activities before, during and after the class that favor the participation of the students during the learning process."

Machine Learning (AutoML) for IS majors, non-majors, and MBA students. AutoML is 
simply machine learning where data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selection, 
hyperparameter tuning, as well as most other steps are done automatically, removing 
the need for years of training in machine learning and statistics. Forbes Technology 
Council as well as many others have suggested that 2018 will be the year of automated 
machine learning, and most major technology companies are feverishly developing 
AutoML technologies to stay competitive. In three hours, with no programming, we will 
do what will normally take a data scientist three months. Participants will go through 
the whole data science process from project objective definition, acquisition and 
exploration of data, modeling of the data, interpreting and communicating results, and 
implementing the solution. We will end with a discussion of approaches for teaching 
AutoML. The workshop is appropriate for faculty who have no previous experience with 
machine learning as well as experienced machine learning researchers who have not 
been exposed to AutoML. The instructor has won both college-wide and university-wide 
teaching awards and has taught ML for a decade and AutoML for two years at both the 
undergraduate and graduate level, and his book entitled Automated Machine Learning

However, the previous knowledge requirements for students to adequately assimilate these lessons are more specialised than the ones they obtain during secondary education. On the one hand, the interaction with complexes techniques and materials is needed, and on the other, tools to practice on-demand are required in the current learning. So, this is an excellent opportunity for the creation of data analysis tools for educational purpose that could be considered as a starting point of a broad area of application. This paper presents a pedagogical support tool aimed to facilitate the student approach to the basic knowledge of data mining through the practice of the analysis of online analytical processing (OLAP). It is a prototype that allows the visualisation of the multidimensional cubes generated with all possible combinations of the dimensions of the data set, as well as their storage in databases, the recovery operations for views, and the implementation of an algorithm for the selection of the optimal view set for materialising the set of records resulting from a search of the database, and computing the materialisation costs and total records recovered. The prototype also carries out and present recurrent patterns and association rules while considering factors such as support variables and reliability. All of this is steps are done explicitly to aid the students to comprehend the generation process of data cubes in the data mining discipline."

The contribution of computer science education to the field of data science education is therefore evident. As computer science educators, however, we can benefit from adapting concepts and methods of data science education as well. For example, working with real data sets, a common practice in data science education, can benefit computer science students, giving them better sense of real-life problems; Statistical thinking, a fundamental thinking skill for data scientists, can enhance computational thinking as a real-life problem-solving skill. This BOF will provide a platform to discuss both the possible benefits computer science educators can earn from the emerging field of data science education and practical pedagogical methods to achieve these benefits."

The goal of this BoF is to bring together a community of educators who are teaching interdisciplinary and/or data science courses with the goal of expanding a support network of data science faculty and developing educational standards for undergraduate data science curricula. We would like to leverage the SIGCSE community to bring together people from different disciplines, institutions, and organizations. The session will include a chance for participants to discuss their experience with and challenges with interdisciplinary course teaching. The second half of the hour will be spent trying to identify common themes to be addressed in follow up discussions and meetings.

We demonstrate this approach using a digitized Legacy of Slavery (LoS) archival dataset collection from the Maryland State Archives (MSA) and illustrate the socio-technical challenges in establishing this learning environment. We provide a step-by-step process involved in accessing, developing, and integrating diﬀerent infrastructure elements.

To as a ﬁrst step, unique dataset by downloading the put through rigorous exploration, cleaning, and visualization archivists, computer technology the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to a unique set of digitized archival data with a speciﬁc focus on contextual aspects due to the data’s historical value and sensitivity. The collaborative process used open-source and readily accessible tools to create meaningful visualizations as an arrange-ment that ﬂows together conducive for educators to teach. The visualizations use the spatial and temporal characteristics of the datasets to produce graphs and charts for a graphical view of the datasets. The visualizations constructed are responsive to present the data by instant connections to the datasets dynamically. The integration of these digital artifacts obtained from each dataset was carried out through Jupyter Notebooks (JNs). These iDCNs are unlike the traditional digital notebooks that provide a space for students to take notes and collect clippings of text. Instead, the iDCNs developed in this project are a novel set of educational tools that allow text and software code to co-exist and be rendered in a single document coherently for instructors and students to follow the text with visual representations back-to-back. The iDCNs are also equipped with live examples of basic natural language processing on certain text-rich features of these dataset collections. The open-source nature of this project’s setup and cloud-based distribution of these digital artifacts pave the way for students from under served communities to take advantage of a unique way of learning and to perform hands-on work on marketable software tools, preparing them for a successful career. The contributions of this paper to the ﬁelds of HASS and other non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) backgrounds lie in the idea of providing an “always-on” cloud-based pedagogical environment for aspiring students and researchers worldwide to analyze, learn and unearth stories through data science driven approach on a cultural dataset, in our case, the LoS dataset collection."

This is largely due to the increasing computational demands of many engineering and domain science research objectives. Thus, there is a demonstrated need to train students with and without computer science backgrounds in core PDC concepts. Given the rise of data science and other data-enabled computational fields, we propose several data-intensive pedagogic modules that are used to teach PDC using message-passing programming with the Message Passing Interface (MPI). These modules employ activities that are common in database systems and scientific workflows that are likely to be employed by domain scientists. Our hypothesis is that using application-driven pedagogic materials facilitates student learning by providing the context needed to fully appreciate the goals of the activities.We evaluated the efficacy of using the data-intensive pedagogic modules to teach core PDC concepts using a sample of graduate students enrolled in a high performance computing course at Northern Arizona University. In the sample, only 30% of students have a traditional computer science background. We found that the hands-on application-driven approach was generally successful at helping students learn core PDC concepts."

The TARs were concurrently participating in a senior-level Pedagogy of Data Science seminar. We present a strategy for collecting and systematizing our observations, and present actionable conclusions that can be used to improve future offerings of the course.

327fa93680f220540675b3fd0848a48981f2353a,accurate measurement of lexical sophistication in esl with reference to learner data,"One commonly used measure of lexical sophistication is the Advanced Guiraud (AG; [9]), whose formula requires frequency band counts (e.g., COCA; [13]). However, the accuracy of this measure is affected by the particular 2000-word frequency list selected as the basis for its calculations [27]. For example, possible issues arise when frequency lists that are based solely on native speaker corpora are used as a target for second language (L2) learners (e.g., [8]) because the exposure frequencies for L2 learners may vary from that of native speakers. Such L2 variation from comparable native speakers may be due to first language (L1) culture, home country teaching materials, or the text types which L2 learners commonly encounter. This paper addresses the aforementioned problem through an English as a Second Language (ESL) frequency list validation. Our validation is established on two sources: (1) the New General Service List (NGSL; [4]) which is based on the Cambridge English Corpus (CEC) and (2) written data from the 4.2 million-word Pitt English Language Institute Corpus (PELIC). Using open-source data science tools and natural language processing technologies, the paper demonstrates that more distinct measurable lexical sophistication differences across levels are discernible when learner-oriented frequency lists (as compared to general corpora frequency lists) are used as part of a lexical measure such as AG. The results from this research will be useful in teaching contexts where lexical proficiency is measured or assessed, and for materials and test developers who rely on such lists as being representative of known vocabulary at different levels of proficiency. This research applies data-driven exploration of learner corpora to vocabulary acquisition and pedagogy, thus closing a loop between educational data mining and classroom applications."

The submitted programs are largely assessed on their correctness to the given problem, and not against secure software coding practices. In our experience, student programs typically do not follow secure coding practices, making them susceptible to security problems. Given the general lack of strong emphasis on security concepts in introductory programming courses, students tend to neglect applying secure coding practices. The goal of this “Work in Progress” is helping students to reduce vulnerabilities in their programs and eliminate coding errors. We will investigate how errors occur, how students interpret and correct these errors, develop metrics to measure how coding standards for security are used, and provide informative feedback and actionable guidelines to students and instructors. The analysis will emphasize security Knowledge Skills and Abilities (KSAs) identified within the National Initiative Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework [1]. A list of secure coding practices was compiled using two different resources: SEI CERT Coding Standard [2] and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) [3]. The selected coding practices are applicable to C++ and Java. Each secure coding practice is assigned a weight reflecting its importance and severity. We consider a set of 43 students’ programming assignments in C++ and Java, with all of them being anonymized for Personally Identifiable Information. Each assignment typically has different coding practices that are relevant, which is a result of the difference in requirements among assignments. The problem description of each assignment is analyzed to determine the applicable secure coding practices to each submitted assignment. Our quantitative analysis gives a score out of five to each secure coding practice based on the extent it was implemented: zero implies a rule is not being addressed, while five implies a rule is implemented effectively. Any score between zero and five is based on varying degrees of effectiveness. Subsequently, rules that consistently did not score high for the programs will be given to instructors as a recommended focus in relevant CS courses."

Whether the course will serve as an outreach vehicle to students of all majors, including non-technical ones, or as a first course in a formal program of some sort, we will be exchanging points of view regarding both topic coverage and pedagogical approaches. Regarding topics, we'll raise questions on the relative emphases of statistics, programming (should R be the vehicle? how about Python? other languages?), machine learning (which algorithms?), other tools, and appropriate data sets. Participants who have taught such a course will be invited to describe some of their approaches, especially if they've used such active learning methods as flipped classrooms.

But in data science and its applications (e.g., public health, politics), modeling is a necessary component of data literacy. To address this need, we should teach introductory students modeling from the beginning, connecting the content to the modern world of data science. This may have the added benefit of bringing coherence to statistics. We teach this content using research-based pedagogy – the practicing connections framework – and utilize new technology (CourseKata.org) capable of conducting experiments to continuously improve instruction. We are thus able to test theories of how students learn difficult, time-consuming concepts, such as the concept of a statistical model. Together, the curriculum, pedagogical theory, and technology provide a process to make the book incrementally better at producing a modern, coherent, and flexible understanding of statistics."

The literature suggests that the need for data science and data analytics competencies in industry and academia is accelerating at a rapid pace. At the same time, census and demographic data predict that the pool of traditional college age students will continue to decrease. To meet the increasing demand for a data capable workforce, it is essential to leverage the non-traditional student pool, reskilling and upskilling the current workforce, simply because the traditional student output is nowhere near sufficient to meet the need. The current work is to develop a new program designed to provide adult learners with bachelor’s degrees and post baccalaureate certificates in Data Analytics. This results in upskilling or reskilling the existing workforce to add value to industry and academia. The program is differentiated from traditional programs by catering to non-traditional students through specific pedagogies such as incorporating required mathematics competencies into Data Analytics courses, using specific pedagogies proven to work with the non-traditional population, as well as removing constraints by offering evening courses, easing registration obstacles, etc. The paper suggests a proposed curriculum, as well as discussing the rationale behind each differentiated option."

Across the many waves of feminist movements and throughout the halls of humanities and social sciences departments around the world, feminist thought and feminist practices are heavily contested and often come into conflict. From difference and discord arise efforts to make both feminism and the world a more inclusive and just place. Yet there remain strong tensions over how to define feminism, how to realize feminists’ demands, how to apply feminist theory to a wide variety of subject matter, and how to bridge the gaps between theory and practice to build a better world for all. In an ambitious attempt to resolve some of those tensions in the field of data science, Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein’s 2021 book, Data Feminism, poses seven principles and strategies that are worthy of examination for those of us who might not hold the title of “data scientist,” but work with data nonetheless.

New data science education programs, which are being launched at a growing rate, are designed for multiple levels, beginning with elementary school pupils. Machine learning is an important element of data science that requires an extensive background in mathematics. While it is possible to teach the principles of machine learning as a black box, it might be difficult to improve algorithm performance without a white box understanding of the underlaying learning algorithms. In this paper, we suggest pedagogical methods to support white box understanding of machine learning algorithms for learners who lack the needed graduate level of mathematics, particularly high school computer science pupils."

Deploying a data transformation strategy requires a workforce which is up to the job in terms of knowledge, experience and capabilities. The application of analytics needs to address organizational needs, invoke proper methods, build on adequate infrastructures and ensure availability of the right skills to the right people. such upskilling requires a focus on conceptual understanding affecting both the pedagogical approach and the complementary learning assessment tools, This paper is about the application of advanced educational concepts to the teaching and evaluation of statistical and data science related concepts. Two educational elements will be included in the discussion: i) the use of simulations to facilitate problem based experiential learning and ii) an emphasis on information quality, as the overall objective of statistics and data science activity. 
 
We begin with an introduction to conceptual thinking and meaning equivalence and the application of Meaning Equivalence Reusable Learning Objects (MERLO) in the classroom. We then describe how MERLO and concept science can be applied in the domain of Statistics and Data Science. Section 3 is about the use of simulations in statistical education.

81c2b2415e86b9a5c12c817a5c5296cb678df242,econometrics pedagogy and cloud computing training the next generation of economists and data scientists,"Abstract This paper describes how cloud computing tools widely used in the instruction of data scientists can be introduced and taught to economics students as part of their curriculum. The demonstration centers around a workflow where the instructor creates a virtual server and the students only need Internet access and a web browser to complete in-class tutorials, assignments, or exams. Given how prevalent cloud computing platforms are becoming for data science, introducing these techniques into students’ econometrics training would prepare them to be more competitive when job hunting, while making instructors and administrators re-think what a computer laboratory means on campus."

Through funding from the National Science Foundation, we are developing instruments that measure attitudes toward data science in the context of an introductory, college-level course. This talk focuses on preliminary work to develop the Student Survey of Motivational Attitudes toward Data Science (S-SOMADS), which includes construct development, item creation involving content experts from numerous disciplines, pilot testing, and item refinement. Along with the student instrument, we intend to develop an instructor attitude instrument as well as an environment inventory to capture instructor attitudes and course characteristics that may be associated with attitudes. This family of instruments, based on Expectancy-Value Theory, will enable data science education researchers to evaluate pedagogical innovations, create course assessments, and measure instructional effectiveness relating to student attitudes. We invite instructors of data science courses to participate in this project to discuss data science topics, serve as subject matter experts, or to collect pilot data from themselves and their students."

The goal of the study is to understand the important features, and to derive models for predicting student retention. Issues dealing with real world data, for example variable definition, missing data handling, and data cleaning were discussed. A new recursive feature elimination based feature selection method was developed. This study derived features and models for four different student groups, the first-generation students, the African American students, the Hispanic students, and the disabled students. The features identified and the predictive models built were compared crossed the four groups."
ef770472bb75b02c72a3564d41349b1b51bdaa0a,addressing confirmation bias in middle school data science education,"More research is needed involving middle school students' engagement in the statistical problem-solving process, particularly the beginning process steps: formulate a question and make a plan to collect data/consider the data. Further, the increased availability of large-scale electronically accessible data sets is an untapped area of study. This interpretive study examined middle school students' understanding of statistical concepts involved in making a plan to collect data to answer a statistical question within a social issue context using data available on the internet. Student artifacts, researcher notes, and audio and video recordings from nine groups of 20 seventh-grade students in two gifted education pull-out classes at a suburban middle school were used to answer the study research questions. Data were analyzed using a priori codes from previously developed frameworks and by using an inductive approach to find themes.Three themes that emerged from data related to confirmation bias. Some middle school students held preconceptions about the social issues they chose to study that biased their statistical questions. This in turn influenced the sources of data students used to answer their questions. Confirmation bias is a serious issue that is exacerbated due to endless sources of data electronically available. We argue that this type of bias should be addressed early in students' educational experiences. Based on the findings from this study, we offer recommendations for future research and implications for statistics and data science education."
f7e707ca899b323afd36cf176f0d8938f7c93aff,st century toolkit for optimizing population health through precision nutrition,"ABSTRACT Scientific, technological, and economic progress over the last 100 years all but eradicated problems of widespread food shortage and nutrient deficiency in developed nations. But now society is faced with a new set of nutrition problems related to energy imbalance and metabolic disease, which require new kinds of solutions. Recent developments in the area of new analytical tools enable us to systematically study large quantities of detailed and multidimensional metabolic and health data, providing the opportunity to address current nutrition problems through an approach called Precision Nutrition. This approach integrates different kinds of “big data” to expand our understanding of the complexity and diversity of human metabolism in response to diet. With these tools, we can more fully elucidate each individual's unique phenotype, or the current state of health, as determined by the interactions among biology, environment, and behavior. The tools of precision nutrition include genomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, phenotyping, high-throughput analytical chemistry techniques, longitudinal tracking with body sensors, informatics, data science, and sophisticated educational and behavioral interventions. These tools are enabling the development of more personalized and predictive dietary guidance and interventions that have the potential to transform how the public makes food choices and greatly improve population health."
09832f2c4e94916ca99a3cf8f1c5247c1d4c0b7a,data science applied to pedagogical methodologies focused on changing the negative perception of the oil and gas industry in colombia,"
 In Colombia, one of the biggest challenges for the oil and gas industry is to generate a sound reputation and a new perception about its benefits to the communities located in the area of influence. Even though, the oil and gas industry generates between 9 to 11% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Colombia, there is a negative perception of local communities due to the impacts of the operations of the industry on the people and environment; as a consequence, the implementation of pedagogical methodologies to educate communities about the sustainable view of the modern Oil and gas Industry, and the importance to the access to energy and water is a need.
 In this sense, programs such as Energy4Me and PetrolCopa Reto Escolar have been implemented over the last two years in different regions of Colombia, which have allowed the collection of a considerable amount of data with great technical and social value from more than 10000 participants. This information has been refined, processed and analyzed to show how data science generates added value in the continuous improvement of the methodologies implemented by the data center of SPE Colombian Section; thus, improving relationship between industry and local communities through a fluent communication and knowledge channel.
 The analysis of the information and its implementation in these educational programs was carried out through the application of different statistical methods and digital tools for processing and monitoring information, which resulted in the design of optimal processes for the collection of structured and unstructured data such as; community behavior parameters, social problems, demographic characteristics and acquired technical knowledge. This process took into account at the same time other related variables such as the heterogeneity of rural communities, logistical and operational challenges and the social conditions of each region. The data gathering process involved 500 volunteers in more than 5000 people from different regions, ethnic groups, ages, gender and level of education. Once the information was correlated and the methodological approach of the programs improved, trends and direct relationships were established between the data analyzed and the decrease in the rate of rejection by the communities towards Oil and Gas industry in the study regions."

0407bbeb69cccb430e02ee759103618d378a44a2,explainability in machine learning a pedagogical perspective,"Given the importance of integrating of explainability into machine learning, at present, there are a lack of pedagogical resources exploring this. Specifically, we have found a need for resources in explaining how one can teach the advantages of explainability in machine learning. Often pedagogical approaches in the field of machine learning focus on getting students prepared to apply various models in the real world setting, but much less attention is given to teaching students the various techniques one could employ to explain a model’s decision-making process. Furthermore, explainability can benefit from a narrative structure that aids one in understanding which techniques are governed by which questions about the data. We provide a pedagogical perspective on how to structure the learning process to better impart knowledge to students and researchers in machine learning, when and how to implement various explainability techniques as well as how to interpret the results. We discuss a system of teaching explainability in machine learning, by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of various opaque and transparent machine learning models, as well as when to utilize specific explainability techniques and the various frameworks used to structure the tools for explainability. Among discussing concrete assignments, we will also discuss ways to structure potential assignments to best help students learn to use explainability as a tool alongside any given machine learning application. Data science professionals completing the course will have a birds-eye view of a rapidly developing area and will be confident to deploy machine learning more widely. A preliminary analysis on the effectiveness of a recently delivered course following the structure presented here is included as evidence supporting our pedagogical approach."

Jupyter notebooks were originally developed for sharing of scientific results and reproducible open science. However, when delivered through a cloud-based server, they have huge benefits for teaching, including removing the need to install any software locally or require any specific machine to be used by students. UC Berkeley has extensive experience teaching via Jupyter, including the popular introductory Data 8 course, small Data Science Modules in non- Data Science classes, and advanced work in the Data 100 and Data 102 ( Machine Learning) classes. There is a library of OER curricular materials to share between institutions. In addition, Multiple languages and interfaces can be served, from Jupyter in multiple languages, Rstudio, and even a Linux desktop, as well as auto-grading approaches. We are interested to share experiences across institutions utilizing this approach. The use of teaching Jupyterhubs to date, both for introductory to Data Science courses, as well as more advanced topics is growing rapidly. We would like to have a conversation about how to use Jupyterhubs and teaching Jupyter notebooks from a variety of instructors and institutions. We are also interested in how to provide these types of resources to additional educational settings who may be more resource constrained."
f56425ec56586dcfd2694ab83643e9e76f314e91, years of data science,"ABSTRACT More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science” programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a $100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients of the current “data science moment,” including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for “scaling up” to “big data.” This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today’s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

The authors analyzed the current sets of competencies of data science and analytics, identified the problems of organizing their development, considered modern trends in the instrumental support of the learning process. Particular attention is paid to the peculiarities of the development of soft skills in data science and analytics, which should be taken into account in systems and platforms for learning support when building models for the formation of personalized content and learning paths within the course. The necessity of creating a multi-agent software application to support the pedagogical design of the course is substantiated, which allows to adapt the capabilities of modern software systems and learning platforms to increase the efficiency of group interaction and the formation of soft skills necessary in the implementation of data analysis projects. The results of the conceptual design of a multi-agent application integrated with modern learning platforms are presented: a UML diagram of use cases is proposed that provides support for the personalization of training not only at the individual, but also at the command level, the base classes of agents are highlighted and an ontological model is developed to support the formation of soft skills in data science and analytics, directions of further research are determined. The results obtained will be useful to support the formation of a full set of competencies for data science and analytics, as well as to increase the efficiency of group work and support the personalization of content in a hybrid or online learning format, both in the higher education system and in corporate divisions."

In this article, we reflect on JSDSE’s relevance to K-12 education and how it might increase its influence in this area. We characterize JSDSE’s K-12 impact partially in terms of its ability to foster statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). We also introduce a new construct, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT , to more fully capture the K-12 contributions JSDSE can make. Our analysis draws upon the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher (the first author) and a statistics education researcher (the second author). The first author of the article surveyed recent JSDSE issues to identify and reflect upon articles with implications for his teaching practice. The second author framed the first author’s article reflections in terms of their connections to SKT and SKT2. Drawing upon our collaborative analysis, we propose strategies to help JSDSE more fully realize its potential to contribute to SKT and SKT2. We explain how acting on the proposed strategies may help JSDSE readers, authors, and editors bridge the persistent historical gap between formal scholarship and practice in K-12 education."

Since this assistance is not always restricted to a particular schedule, it produces instability in the daily tasks that teachers have to perform. To avoid this, this study implements a closed-domain Chatbot for Data Science that uses as a Question Answering System and works as an assistant to teachers in specific questions that students may have. In addition, it allows the students to check their knowledge in any related topic by the automatic generation of questions according to the chosen topic. The System also has an automatic correction process that compares the response given by the student with the correct one. Such features were implemented using the latest Deep Learning models oriented to Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as Transformers architectures. Although the response time is relatively long in some cases, it generated good answers as well as questions. In future works, the authors propose to optimize the system in terms of speed and quality of results. To this end, the reduction in the number of steps is required by the system, as well as finding more efficient solutions according to the research progress in NLP."

A particularly vulnerable, yet less studied population includes our youngest children, ages zero to five, whose proximal and distal contexts have been exponentially affected with unknown impacts on health, education, and social-emotional well-being. Integrated administrative data systems could be important tools for understanding these impacts. This article has three aims to guide research on the impacts of COVID-19 for this critical population using integrated data systems (IDS). First, it presents a conceptual data model informed by developmental-ecological theory and epidemiological frameworks to study young children. This data model presents five developmental resilience pathways (i.e. early learning, safe and nurturing families, health, housing, and financial/employment) that include direct and indirect influencers related to COVID-19 impacts and the contexts and community supports that can affect outcomes. Second, the article outlines administrative datasets with relevant indicators that are commonly collected, could be integrated at the individual level, and include relevant linkages between children and families to facilitate research using the conceptual data model. Third, this paper provides specific considerations for research using the conceptual data model that acknowledge the highly-localised political response to COVID-19 in the US. It concludes with a call to action for the population data science community to use and expand IDS capacities to better understand the intermediate and long-term impacts of this pandemic on young children."

All of this behind-the-scenes labor takes time away from the pedagogically-meaningful work of teaching students. Over the past five years, the authors of this paper have created and updated eight courses for an undergraduate data science program that serves over 2,000 students per year. We present four case studies from our teaching experiences that highlight major challenges in maintaining and updating technical courses: 1) There were intricate dependencies between course materials, so making updates to one part of the course would require updating many other parts. 2) We needed to maintain several variants of course materials such as assignments. 3) We wrote large amounts of ad-hoc custom software infrastructure to manage logistics. 4) We could not easily reuse software written by others. Our case studies point to design ideas for instructor-oriented tools that can reduce the logistical complexities of teaching at scale, thus letting instructors focus on the substance of teaching rather than on mundane logistics."
394dbab135ba9aa9d39832659f95956bb4b20160,the emergence of computer science and law the new legal paradigm for law and policy practice in the computational age of algorithmic reasoning and big data practice,"Some thirty years ago “law and economics” emerged as a new paradigm of legal reasoning by providing new legal resolutions to a set a problems that were particularly suited to the application of economics in the legal process. Today algorithms and data, software-based systems, and technology solutions like blockchain both stress existing legal practice and offer new avenues for solving legal problems. This paper proposes that the rise of “computer science and law” as a new legal paradigm is emerging in ways that leverage and respond to the application and ability of computer science knowledge and reasoning to answer novel and venerable legal problems. 
The paper's analytic approach maps the boundaries of law and computer science in this new paradigm, against the stressors that necessitate new approaches with the value of technology solutions already revolutionizing other sectors. The paper answers questions such as what is persuasive or explanatory about law, what social function does it serve, and how is legal reasoning distinctive from philosophy, sociology, economics, and computer science? Following this analytic approach, the paper presents the current evolution of legal pedagogy, practice, and expectations and contributes to a deeper comparative understanding of how law can serve important social goals. The paper begins with a definitional section. Descriptions from jurisprudence and legal theory provide a baseline of how philosophy and social sciences differentiate “law” from other disciplines, based on the nature of the reasoning, justifications, outcomes and knowledge that law entails. Leveraging what is distinctive about legal reasoning and knowledge, a historical review of computer and data science and artificial intelligence provides a view of the evolution of reasoning and knowledge is modeled using software to accomplish tasks relevant to law. 
The paper explores how legal practice is evolving to challenges and opportunities posed by computational systems. The paper reviews the “legalhacker” movement that began as a software programming and policy advocacy effort and other “computation law"" examples of innovations in law and policy practice, and focus on technology policy issues. A survey of new legal pedagogy focused on teaching data science, software programming and other technical skills reveals a roadmap of computer science skillsets and techniques that are a current focus for legal educators. Review and comparisons of the information technology response of “legaltech” with “fintech” IT innovations focused on finance or other sectors will reveal the relative trends and strengths observed in the space. 
Finally, two analytic approaches are proposed for evaluating the strength of new technology tools and law and policy practice approaches. A set of key features identify metrics for evaluating automating legal reasoning systems ability to predict, explain, and defend legal decisions. A roadmap of technical skills and areas of focus for new law and policy practitioners provide a useful rubric for development of new practice groups, outsourcing and IT strategies, and legal training focused on “computer science and law” practice. 
Whether the challenge of legal practice in administrative law with comment dockets numbering in the tens of millions, protecting fundamental legal principles in practices using complex software systems controlling the fate of defendants, or improving and expanding access to law and policy services, the paper describes the expanding role of computer science and law and a path forward for legal practitioners in the computational age."

74a76b944a4ac04339a2ad6b0c660d1824585cf2,i love math only if its coding a case study of student experiences in an introduction to data science course,"Many important voices--including The National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the Dana Center’s Launch Years initiative, and others--advocate for expanding the traditional course offerings in high school mathematics and statistics to include courses such as the Introduction to Data Science (IDS). To date, the research on the IDS course has primarily focused on pedagogy, professional learning for teachers, and the curriculum. This mixed-methods case study expands our understanding by analyzing the perspective of IDS students at a California public high school. Self-determination theory provides a useful frame for interpreting how these students experience the IDS course. The theory focuses on conditions for students to engage in meaningful learning: competence (self-efficacy), autonomy (agency), and relatedness (a sense of belonging). The findings from this case study suggest the IDS students feel confident, empowered, and part of a vibrant community, unlike previous mathematics and statistics courses they may have completed; and use specific language to describe their joy in problem-solving and the accessibility of the course. These findings have implications for the development and refinement of any high school data science course, including IDS."

This paper describes the data science course open to all master students of the University of Twente. We outline the main challenges of teaching a large and heterogeneous population of non-computer science students about data science and how we addressed them, as well as a historical perspective on how the course grew and evolved."
2a56fb071406e97b1239b169ed41c4b0ef9d573f,thesis plan the effect of data science teaching for nonstem students,"In recent years, the interest in Data Science has increased in both industry and academia. Historically, access to this discipline has been redirected to STEM professionals. However, the ubiquity of cloud computing and the simplicity of modern programming languages such as Python and R have enabled non-STEM students and professionals to leverage it especially to analyze data. Similarly, with what has been conveyed with computational thinking in terms of enabling non-STEM students with com technological competencies, this article aims to present a proposal for improving the teaching of data science specifically to non-stem students."
82feed9f0f8d077046b9b8be36e664483a66e33b,teaching stats for data science,"ABSTRACT “Data science” is a useful catchword for methods and concepts original to the field of statistics, but typically being applied to large, multivariate, observational records. Such datasets call for techniques not often part of an introduction to statistics: modeling, consideration of covariates, sophisticated visualization, and causal reasoning. This article re-imagines introductory statistics as an introduction to data science and proposes a sequence of 10 blocks that together compose a suitable course for extracting information from contemporary data. Recent extensions to the mosaic packages for R together with tools from the “tidyverse” provide a concise and readable notation for wrangling, visualization, model-building, and model interpretation: the fundamental computational tasks of data science."
9ebdb2846e997c180f629c4e01257aa164d3cbf2,an extensible online environment for teaching data science concepts through gamification,"Learn2Mine is a cloud-based environment developed to support the teaching of data science. This paper discusses the architecture of Learn2Mine, the research that guided its development, and the pilot implementation and formative assessment of its use in teaching data science. Learn2Mine was pilot-tested in Fall 2013 in an introductory data science source. At the end of the term, a survey of students concerning their experiences with the environment was conducted. Quantitative analysis of survey data showed that student opinion about the usefulness of the tool for learning course content was positive. Through open-ended comments, students provided constructive feedback on how the system might be improved. To collect expert opinion on both the didactic and usability aspects of the Learn2Mine system, a number of experts were enlisted to try the system. Experts responded to a survey regarding criteria typically expected of instructional software, such as system usability and flexibility, as well as accuracy and organization of content. Overall, the responses from experts were extremely positive. A plan for further development of the system, based on these results, is presented along with information on the developers' plans for making the environment available for use at other institutions."
bb3456407ee2ae4abe03f0f4cd9775fcfa14764b,teaching precursors to data science in introductory and second courses in statistics,"Statistics students need to develop the capacity to make sense of the staggering amount of information collected in our increasingly data-centered world. Data science is an important part of modern statistics, but our introductory and second statistics courses often neglect this fact. This paper discusses ways to provide a practical foundation for students to learn to ""compute with data"" as defined by Nolan and Temple Lang (2010), as well as develop ""data habits of mind"" (Finzer, 2013). We describe how introductory and second courses can integrate two key precursors to data science: the use of reproducible analysis tools and access to large databases. By introducing students to commonplace tools for data management, visualization, and reproducible analysis in data science and applying these to real-world scenarios, we prepare them to think statistically in the era of big data."
f6b3505e06b1b19806e35524adbafa70c79851d9,data science in statistics curricula preparing students to think with data,"A growing number of students are completing undergraduate degrees in statistics and entering the workforce as data analysts. In these positions, they are expected to understand how to use databases and other data warehouses, scrape data from Internet sources, program solutions to complex problems in multiple languages, and think algorithmically as well as statistically. These data science topics have not traditionally been a major component of undergraduate programs in statistics. Consequently, a curricular shift is needed to address additional learning outcomes. The goal of this article is to motivate the importance of data science proficiency and to provide examples and resources for instructors to implement data science in their own statistics curricula. We provide case studies from seven institutions. These varied approaches to teaching data science demonstrate curricular innovations to address new needs. Also included here are examples of assignments designed for courses that foster engagement of undergraduates with data and data science. [Received November 2014. Revised July 2015.]"
0b1798c5856ab9c2bd2b9a465e556391e19abf83,communitydriven data analysis training for biology,"The primary problem with the explosion of biomedical datasets is not the data itself, not computational resources, and not the required storage space, but the general lack of trained and skilled researchers to manipulate and analyze these data. Eliminating this problem requires development of comprehensive educational resources. Here we present a community-driven framework that enables modern, interactive teaching of data analytics in life sciences and facilitates the development of training materials. The key feature of our system is that it is not a static but a continuously improved collection of tutorials. By coupling tutorials with a web-based analysis framework, biomedical researchers can learn by performing computation themselves through a web-browser without the need to install software or search for example datasets. Our ultimate goal is to expand the breadth of training materials to include fundamental statistical and data science topics and to precipitate a complete re-engineering of undergraduate and graduate curricula in life sciences."

Geometric and topological inference employs many tools from Computational Geometry and Applied Topology. It has connections to Manifold Learning and provides the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of the rapidly evolving field of Topological Data Analysis. 
 
Building on a rigorous treatment of simplicial complexes and distance functions, this book covers various aspects of the field, from data representation and combinatorial questions to manifold reconstruction and persistent homology. This first book on the subject can serve for teaching in a mathematical or computer science department, and will benefit to scientists and engineers interested in a geometric approach to Data Science."
f441c5e722a8ac8bd0099be40216ff0c52b5c28b,getting messy with authentic data exploring the potential of using data from scientific research to support student data literacy,"Data are becoming increasingly important in science and society, and thus data literacy is a vital asset to students as they prepare for careers in and outside science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and go on to lead productive lives. In this paper, we discuss why the strongest learning experiences surrounding data literacy may arise when students are given opportunities to work with authentic data from scientific research. First, we explore the overlap between the fields of quantitative reasoning, data science, and data literacy, specifically focusing on how data literacy results from practicing quantitative reasoning and data science in the context of authentic data. Next, we identify and describe features that influence the complexity of authentic data sets (selection, curation, scope, size, and messiness) and implications for data-literacy instruction. Finally, we discuss areas for future research with the aim of identifying the impact that authentic data may have on student learning. These include defining desired learning outcomes surrounding data use in the classroom and identification of teaching best practices when using data in the classroom to develop students’ data-literacy abilities."

Subsequently, we highlight key data science approaches and best practices, which we believe are more appropriate for the security domain. Unfortunately, the uptake of these approaches and practices has not been satisfactory so far. Hence, we present our reasons and then invite more discussion on why these ""seemingly better ideas"" are not yet so popular as the basic ideas and techniques. We then discuss our experiences with a course on security analytics that we have been teaching for over three years now."
6c97d423c3949874040fe10941670d0fb4c23273,easytouse cloud computing for teaching data science,"ABSTRACT One of the biggest hurdles of teaching data science and programming techniques to beginners is simply getting started with the technology. With multiple versions of the same coding language available (e.g., Python 2 and Python 3), various additional libraries and packages to install, as well as integrated development environments to navigate, the first step can be the most daunting. We show the advantages of using cloud computing to solve this issue and demonstrate one way of implementing it to allow beginners to get started with coding immediately. Using user-friendly Jupyter notebooks along with the interactive capabilities possible through Binder, we provide introductory Python and SQL material that students can access without downloading anything. This lets students to get started with coding right away without getting frustrated figuring out what to install. Example introductory modules on using Python and SQL for data analysis are provided through GitHub at https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/ada-intro-python and https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/ada-intro-sql."

As faculty and administrators enter the race to provide data science training and attract new students, the road map for teaching data science remains elusive. In 2019, 69 college and university faculty teaching data science courses and developing data science curricula were surveyed to learn about their curricula, computing tools, and challenges they face in their classrooms. Faculty reported teaching a variety of computing skills in introductory data science (albeit fewer computing topics than statistics topics), and that one of the biggest challenges they face is teaching computing to a diverse audience with varying preparation. The ever-evolving nature of data science is a major hurdle for faculty teaching data science courses, and a call for more data science teaching resources was echoed in many responses."
dcb19e6af74e2589859e395f30eca8bfd17ce98f,using r in hydrology a review of recent developments and future directions,"Abstract. The open-source programming language R has gained a central place in the hydrological sciences over the last decade, driven by the availability of diverse hydro-meteorological data archives and the development of open-source computational tools. The growth of R's usage in hydrology is reflected in the number of newly published hydrological packages, the strengthening of online user communities, and the popularity of training courses and events. In this paper, we explore the benefits and advantages of R's usage in hydrology, such as the democratization of data science and numerical literacy, the enhancement of reproducible research and open science, the access to statistical tools, the ease of connecting R to and from other languages, and the support provided by a growing community. This paper provides an overview of a typical hydrological workflow based on reproducible principles and packages for retrieval of hydro-meteorological data, spatial analysis, hydrological modelling, statistics, and the design of static and dynamic visualizations and documents. We discuss some of the challenges that arise when using R in hydrology and useful tools to overcome them, including the use of hydrological libraries, documentation, and vignettes (long-form guides that illustrate how to use packages); the role of integrated development environments (IDEs); and the challenges of big data and parallel computing in hydrology. Lastly, this paper provides a roadmap for R's future within hydrology, with R packages as a driver of progress in the hydrological sciences, application programming interfaces (APIs) providing new avenues for data acquisition and provision, enhanced teaching of hydrology in R, and the continued growth of the community via short courses and events."
19aa38fcc4a9ee1429d5bd1b49f5d5ddfe21fafd,teachers as producers of data analytics a case study of a teacherfocused educational data science program,"Educational data science (EDS) is an emerging, interdisciplinary research domain that seeks to improve educational assessment, teaching, and student learning through data analytics. Teachers have been portrayed in the EDS literature as users of pre-constructed data dashboards in educational technologies, with little consideration given to them as active producers of data analytics. This article presents the case study results of an EDS program at a large university in Midwestern U.S.A. in which faculty and instructors were provided with access to institutional data and data analytics technologies in order to explore questions related to their classroom and departmental environments. Semi-structured interviews of program participants were conducted to examine the participants’ experiences as practitioner researchers in EDS. The analysis showed that participants were motivated to participate to improve their learning and educational environments through data analytics, as opposed to developing a research agenda in EDS; that participants experienced a range of barriers related to data literacy; and that participant community support in addition to administrative support are vital to teacher-focused EDS programs. This study adds to a small but growing body of research in EDS and practitioner research that considers teachers as producers and not just consumers of data analytics."
90fa7734fee57f9cbc8a411bc124deb6e5688b85,teaching machines to understand data science code by semantic enrichment of dataflow graphs,"Your computer is continuously executing programs, but does it really understand them? Not in any meaningful sense. That burden falls upon human knowledge workers, who are increasingly asked to write and understand code. They deserve to have intelligent tools that reveal the connections between code and its subject matter. Towards this prospect, we develop an AI system that forms semantic representations of computer programs, using techniques from knowledge representation and program analysis. To create the representations, we introduce an algorithm for enriching dataflow graphs with semantic information. The semantic enrichment algorithm is undergirded by a new ontology language for modeling computer programs and a new ontology about data science, written in this language. Throughout the paper, we focus on code written by data scientists and we locate our work within a larger movement towards collaborative, open, and reproducible science."

Like any new discipline, Data Science brings new perspectives and new tools to address new questions requiring new perspectives on traditionally established concepts. In this paper, we explore a specific component of this discussion, namely the documentation and evaluation of Data Science-related research, teaching, and service contributions for faculty members seeking promotion and tenure within traditional departments of statistics and Biostatistics."

The data analysis techniques need to delve deeper to find valuable information (Sarac 2017). The notion of edge computing is broadly acknowledged. Edge-enabled solutions provide computing, analysis, storage, and control nearer to the edge of the network, which support the efficient processing and decision-making. Machine learning has also attained significant attention in this context due to its flexibility and its ability to provide a variety of supervised, unsupervised, and semisupervised techniques. This research presents a specific model to evaluate the potential correlation of piano teaching using machine learning. The data analysis is performed at the edges of network for efficient results (Tan et al. 2017). The association rule mining technique of machine learning is utilized with the integration of improved T-test method. The improved T-test is performed for the measurement of association rules and proposed a new measure and influence degree of association rules. It is evident from the results that the use of the degree of influence as a measure of association rules to find the potential relevance of multimedia-assistant piano teaching evaluation data is extremely feasible. It overcomes shortcomings of existing measurement standards and reduces the generation of redundant rules. The existing literature highlights the concepts of evaluation of potential correlation and evaluates the advantages. However, there is a lack of an effective strategy for piano teaching. The proposed model performs efficient calculation and storage. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework are verified using the analysis of the actual dataset. The verification results show that it is feasible and valuable to find the potential relevance of multimedia-assisted piano teaching evaluation."

In current computer science curricula, however, these insights are typically locked up in the context of the traditional Intro to Databases class that was developed years (or in some cases, decades) before the modern concept of Data Science arose and embedded in the discussion of legacy data management systems. We consider how to bring these concepts front and center into the emerging wave of Data Science courses, degree programs and even departments."
3bb46ff376c5dc3ad59368a4911c4d97823f1bf7,incentivizing evaluation via limited access to ground truth peerprediction makes things worse,"In many settings, an effective way of evaluating objects of interest is to collect evaluations from dispersed individuals and to aggregate these evaluations together. Some examples are categorizing online content and evaluating student assignments via peer grading. For this data science problem, one challenge is to motivate participants to conduct such evaluations carefully and to report them honestly, particularly when doing so is costly. Existing approaches, notably peer-prediction mechanisms, can incentivize truth telling in equilibrium. However, they also give rise to equilibria in which agents do not pay the costs required to evaluate accurately, and hence fail to elicit useful information. We show that this problem is unavoidable whenever agents are able to coordinate using low-cost signals about the items being evaluated (e.g., text labels or pictures). We then consider ways of circumventing this problem by comparing agents' reports to ground truth, which is available in practice when there exist trusted evaluators---such as teaching assistants in the peer grading scenario---who can perform a limited number of unbiased (but noisy) evaluations. Of course, when such ground truth is available, a simpler approach is also possible: rewarding each agent based on agreement with ground truth with some probability, and unconditionally rewarding the agent otherwise. Surprisingly, we show that the simpler mechanism achieves stronger incentive guarantees given less access to ground truth than a large set of peer-prediction mechanisms."

Here, we describe some of the characteristics of data that students encounter as citizens. We set out some teaching ideas, which focus on a few familiar core ideas—such as exponential growth, estimation, interpreting graphs, measurement, and sampling—set in the authentic context of containing a pandemic. In the final section, we sketch some more ideas on activities to develop student skills essential for civic engagement in a data‐rich world."

This module made use of R, accessed through RStudio, and some popular R packages. After describing initial examples used to fire student enthusiasm, we explain our approach to teaching data visualization using the ggplot2 package. We discuss other module topics, including basic statistical inference, data manipulation with dplyr and tidyr, data bases and SQL, social media sentiment analysis, Likert-type data, reproducible research using RMarkdown, dimension reduction and clustering, and parallel R. We present four lesson outlines and describe the module assessment. We mention some of the problems encountered when teaching the module, and present student feedback and our plans for next year."
f6515c878dacfa6e9cb3456b193d43afefdce446,torta generating mixedmedia gui and commandline app tutorials using operatingsystemwide activity tracing,"Tutorials are vital for helping people perform complex software-based tasks in domains such as programming, data science, system administration, and computational research. However, it is tedious to create detailed step-by-step tutorials for tasks that span multiple interrelated GUI and command-line applications. To address this challenge, we created Torta, an end-to-end system that automatically generates step-by-step GUI and command-line app tutorials by demonstration, provides an editor to trim, organize, and add validation criteria to these tutorials, and provides a web-based viewer that can validate step-level progress and automatically run certain steps. The core technical insight that underpins Torta is that combining operating-system-wide activity tracing and screencast recording makes it easier to generate mixed-media (text+video) tutorials that span multiple GUI and command-line apps. An exploratory study on 10 computer science teaching assistants (TAs) found that they all preferred the experience and results of using Torta to record programming and sysadmin tutorials relevant to classes they teach rather than manually writing tutorials. A follow-up study on 6 students found that they all preferred following the Torta tutorials created by those TAs over the manually-written versions."

Statistics journals have great difficulty accepting papers unlike those previously published. For statisticians with new big ideas a practical strategy is to publish them in many small applied studies which enables one to provide references to work of others. This essay outlines the many concepts, new theory, and important algorithms of our new culture of statistical science called LP MIXED DATA SCIENCE. It provides comprehensive solutions to problems of data analysis and nonparametric modeling of many variables that are continuous or discrete, which does not yet have a large literature. It develops a new modeling approach to nonparametric estimation of the multivariate copula density. We discuss the theory which we believe is very elegant (and can provide a framework for United Statistical Algorithms, for traditional Small Data methods and Big Data methods)."
b03ba4ea63645f7de2a6d48e4b0f4a85df783174,experiences teaching a large upperdivision data science course remotely,"This summer, we introduced a number of structural changes to an existing upper-division data science course to optimize it for remote instruction. With hundreds of students situated in various time zones, a purely synchronous model was not feasible. Our course included a menu of synchronous and asynchronous activities, allowing students to consume content in the way they found most convenient and desirable. We presented lectures asynchronously as a series of short prerecorded videos with conceptual questions following each video. We used the results of these conceptual questions to gauge students' preliminary understanding of the material and to identify common misconceptions. Each week ended with a single synchronous lecture recap session that clarified these misconceptions and provided a summary of the week's material. To supplement lecture content, we offered both prerecorded and live discussion sections, as well as live lab sections. Weekly surveys allowed us to adapt our course to address student concerns in real time. Given the online nature of the course, we were able to depart from the orthodox paper-only exam format used by most courses at our institution. Instead, we held each of our three exams in a format optimized for its respective content. One midterm used a web tool that allowed for both multiple choice and free-response coding questions. The other midterm was on paper and required students to scan their exams. The final exam was a hybrid of the two formats. In this experience report, we present the motivation, implementation details, and effectiveness of these changes."

This study proposes the consultation of YouTube videos (before class), collaborative work through MySQL software (during class) and individual work through MySQL software (after class) in the database subject. The results of machine learning (linear regression) indicate that school activities before, during and after the class positively influence the assimilation of knowledge and development of skills on the administration of the database. Likewise, data science identifies 6 predictive models on the use of the flipped classroom in the educational process by means of the decision tree technique. Finally, the flipped classroom improves the teaching-learning conditions through the performance of creative and active activities."
b9c1de872d56e92ae9224cc5e0e615cb0fd5128e,towards data storytelling to support teaching and learning,"Data science is now impacting the educational sector, with a growing number of commercial products and research prototypes providing learning dashboards as feedback for both educators and students. From a human-centred computing perspective, the end-user's interpretation of these visualisations is a critical challenge to design for, with empirical evidence already showing that `usable' visualisations are not necessarily effective from a teaching and learning perspective. Since an educator's interpretation of visualised data is essentially the construction of a narrative about that student's progress, we draw on the growing body of work on `Data Storytelling' (DS) as the inspiration for a set of enhancements that could be applied to data visualisations to improve their communicative power. We present a pilot study that explores the effectiveness of these DS elements based on educators' responses to paper prototypes. The dual purpose is understanding the contribution of each visual element for data storytelling, and the effectiveness of the enhancements when combined. The results suggest that DS elements could add clarity, especially when there are multiple possible stories in a complex visualisation."

WampServer is a free application that allows the creation of websites considering the use of the database. This research proposes the use of Blended learning in the Development of applications subject in order to facilitate the teaching–learning process in the Database unit. The students discuss and reflect the concepts on the database in the classroom and carry out various school activities on the construction of websites at home through the use of the WampServer application. The sample consists of 28 students who took the Development of applications subject during the 2016 school year. The results of machine learning (linear regression) with 50, 60, and 70% of training indicate that the use of PHP, HTML, and SQL languages in the WampServer application positively influences the assimilation of knowledge and development of skills on web programming. Data science identifies six predictive models about the use of WampServer in the educational process of computing. On the other hand, neural networks determine the factors that influence the assimilation of knowledge and development of skills on web programming. This research recommends the incorporation of the WampServer application in the school activities related to the computer field to create new educational spaces and facilitate the teaching–learning process. Teachers can transform the educational context through the organization and realization of creative activities inside and outside the classroom. Finally, the use of WampServer in Blended learning allows creating new spaces for teaching and learning of computer science because this application favors the assimilation of knowledge and development of skills on web programming."

This article, after a brief reference to the definition of big data, intends to focus attention and reflection on their type to proceed to an extension of their characterisation. One of the hubs to make feasible the use of Big Data in operational contexts is to give a theoretical basis to which to refer. The Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom (DIKW) model correlates these four aspects, concluding in Data Science, which in many ways could revolutionise the established pattern of scientific investigation. The Learning Analytics applications on online learning platforms can be tools for evaluating the quality of teaching. And that is where some problems arise. It becomes necessary to handle with care the available data. Finally, a criterion for deciding whether it makes sense to think of an analysis based on Big Data can be to think about the interpretability and relevance in relation to both institutional and personal processes."

Yet, if not used responsibly — in accordance with legal and ethical norms — the same technology can reinforce economic and political inequities, destabilize global markets, and reaffirm systemic bias. In this paper I discuss an ongoing regulatory effort in New York City, where the goal is to develop a methodology for enabling responsible use of algorithms and data in city agencies. I then highlight some ongoing work that makes part of the Data, Responsibly project, aiming to operationalize fairness, diversity, accountability, transparency, and data protection at all stages of the data science lifecycle.

In this poster, the authors report on problem-driven teaching activities for the capstone project course of data science. The teaching activities consist of problem formation from real-world applications based on data analysis competitions, refining techniques and theories to build domain knowledge, and implementing data science practice to improve students' ability of data thinking and data analysis. Preliminary results indicate that the problem-driven teaching activities can be efficiently carried out to facilitate students to achieve the ability of data analysis, and students attending the course win world-class data analysis competitions, such as KDD (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) Cup and Kaggle."

Using the UHCS dataset as a case study, we develop a set of visualization tools for interacting with and exploring large microstructure and metadata datasets. Based on generic microstructure representations adapted from the field of computer vision, these tools enable image-based microstructure retrieval, as well as spatial maps of both microstructure and related metadata, such as processing conditions or properties measurements. We provide the microstructure image data, processing metadata, and source code for these microstructure exploration tools. The UHCS dataset is intended as a community resource for development and evaluation of microstructure data science techniques, and for creation of microstructure data science teaching modules."
ba67e038b07f4b49924c97f72394fa560f07741a,the asccr frame for learning essential collaboration skills,"Abstract Statistics and data science are especially collaborative disciplines that typically require practitioners to interact with many different people or groups. Consequently, interdisciplinary collaboration skills are part of the personal and professional skills essential for success as an applied statistician or data scientist. These skills are learnable and teachable, and learning and improving collaboration skills provides a way to enhance one’s practice of statistics and data science. To help individuals learn these skills and organizations to teach them, we have developed a framework covering five essential components of statistical collaboration: Attitude, Structure, Content, Communication, and Relationship. We call this the ASCCR Frame. This framework can be incorporated into formal training programs in the classroom or on the job and can also be used by individuals through self-study. We show how this framework can be applied specifically to statisticians and data scientists to improve their collaboration skills and their interdisciplinary impact. We believe that the ASCCR Frame can help organize and stimulate research and teaching in interdisciplinary collaboration and call on individuals and organizations to begin generating evidence regarding its effectiveness."

INTRODUCTION In the context of a traditional Structured Query Language (SQL) database management course, students will learn concepts and skills geared around typical SQL relational databases, such as entities, relationships, normalization, and data structuring. They also learn SQL is typically used to create tables and store data into databases, and that they will need to query data in order to build knowledge from them. Once the students learn how to query traditional databases, they will be introduced to a NoSQL database management system. NoSQL is a relatively new technology that many companies use to collect big data, which is quickly becoming an integral part of modern information systems. The low cost of data storage coupled with cloud based infrastructures allows not only the major, multinational organizations, but also small and medium enterprises to utilize big data (Purcell, 2014). Big data is also becoming an essential aspect of many of today's web applications. Social media sites are storing massive amounts of data on a daily basis. For instance, Facebook logs 135 billion messages per month, and Twitter stores seven terabytes of data every day. Some of the challenges in the use of big data are in identifying how to handle the velocity at which data are collected and deciding the most effective way to store the data. In many cases, traditional SQL databases cannot process data fast enough. In other cases, traditional relational database structures are not flexible enough to handle the varying data types and the inconsistent manner in which the data are collected. To deal with these challenges, major Internet companies, like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon, are moving to NoSQL databases. The term, NoSQL, coined in the late 90's to mean ""Not Only SQL,"" describes non-relational database systems (Berg, Seymour, and Goel, 2013). NoSQL databases allow for large amounts of variable and unstructured data to be stored and used. Common uses for these databases are session stores, user profile stores, mobile apps, e-commerce, and third-party data aggregation (Meijer and Bierman, 2011; Moniruzzaman and Hossain, 2013; Stonebraker, 2010). Because of the challenges of big data, Information Systems (IS) students need to develop a basic understanding of how NoSQL databases work in modern information environments. This need is especially significant with the adoption of cloud-based infrastructures, which makes using this kind of database very likely during their careers. So, a clear understanding of what a NoSQL database looks like, how it differs from a traditional SQL database, and how to use the non-traditional database is necessary for IS college majors in the near future. This paper presents a teaching case for adding a NoSQL lesson to an existing traditional relational database course. This NoSQL teaching case includes instructions on integrating the teaching module into a traditional database management course. Incorporating this NoSQL teaching case into both undergraduate and graduate database management courses will give students experience with this emerging technology. The case uses CouchDB (Couchdb.apache.org), an open source NoSQL database management system software that students can either install on their personal computers or use as a cloud-based service. 2. A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE Goes (2014), editor-in-chief of MIS Quarterly, identified an industry gap in the understanding of big data, its challenges, and its potentials. In the past several years, big data has emerged as a new trend in the field of information technology because of the increasing amounts of data organizations in all sectors are generating, collecting, storing, and analyzing. Goes further explains IS groups are acknowledging this industry gap by offering academic programs specializing in data and business analytics that develop students' skills in data science. The term, big data, describes datasets so large and complex that they are difficult to process using traditional processing applications. …"
917bb32ca5960b94ebec618e8ffc05605f6e812d,case article mapping business problems to analytics solutions surrogate experiential learning in an mba introductory data science and business analytics course,"The case presented in this article can be used as a surrogate experiential learning exercise in an introductory MBA course on data science and business analytics. Students learn about the life cycle of data analytics projects by alternating between study of analytical techniques and participation in a data analytics project running through the course. The project begins as a simple business question which, through sequential discovery, expands into rich discussions and experiences, and culminates with presentations that test students' ability to translate computational results into insights for various stakeholders. In the process, students learn about effective information gathering and discovery, identifying major stakeholders, problem framing and mapping, model identification, data visualization, and basic model implementation. They also learn how to present their findings to different audiences with the greatest possible impact. This approach elicits student engagement, teamwork, and multiple perspectives as students are asked to view themselves and evaluate their colleagues from the point of view of various roles in the company.

6b09b3ac4e3ee4201afac680330190549c7f9b15,statistics and data science must speak together,"The many calls from statisticians and statistics educators over the past three decades for statistics teaching to reflect the practice of statistics have included increasing emphasis on technology as an integral part of statistical practice in any context. That the calls for better and habitual integration of computation have become more insistent is partially a reflection of the rapid developments in statistics itself and the increasingly complex contexts, data and problems, which can and must be tackled. But they also signal escalating focus on what the statistical sciences are, first amidst the buzz of big data and data analytics, and now in the even bigger buzz of data science, and the puzzle and challenge of why the advocacy and great work in teaching statistics have not had sufficiently wide, or, in many domains, sufficiently sustainable, penetration. The discussions on what statistics, statistical practice, and the statistical profession are, and the parallel or overlapping discussions on what data science is or is not, have produced many thoughtful presentations and comments with excellent linkages across both time and the statistical and data science community. In unfortunate contrast, there have also been commentaries demonstrating denial, distancing, or absence of knowledge or understanding of the manner, nature and achievements of developments in—and across all disciplines, workplace and progress—statistics and what is now called data science. In 2013, Rodriguez [15] described statistics as the “most unselfish of sciences”; and that “Statistics improves human welfare not by its own ends, but by its contributions in all fields.” Continuing this theme in 2015, Rodriguez [16] asked “how do we resolve the paradox of a profession that is both invaluable and invisible?” In the same year, Wasserstein [21] commented that increasing the visibility of the statistical profession “is a challenge we have been facing for many years.” Articles such as Gil Press' 2013 “Data Science: What's The Half-Life Of A Buzzword?” [14] are entertaining and of interest in seeing into broader commentaries, but the serious and in-depth comments of leading professional statisticians demonstrate that data science is not a buzzword but represents significant steps forward in capabilities in tackling and solving highly complex challenges involving diversities of data types, sources, and “data deluges” across disciplines, industry, government and society. In his plenary—as always both thoughtprovoking and synthesizing—on accepting the 2019 International Prize in Statistics [5], https://statprize.org/ pdfs/materials/2019Efron-presentation.pdf, Brad Efron commented:"

Having such a vague characterization of a field in the early stages might be natural, but over time maintaining such a broad definition becomes unwieldy and impedes progress. In particular, the teaching of data science is hampered by the seeming need to cover many different points of interest. Data scientists must ultimately identify the core of the field by determining what makes the field unique and what it means to develop new knowledge in data science. In this review we attempt to distill some core ideas from data science by focusing on the iterative process of data analysis and develop some generalizations from past experience. Generalizations of this nature could form the basis of a theory of data science and would serve to unify and scale the teaching of data science to large audiences. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Statistics, Volume 9 is March 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates."

Key high‐level goals of the International Data Science in Schools Project (IDSSP) include having students continually immersed in the cycle of learning from data, and data science being fun to teach and fun to learn. We advocate curiosity‐driven, exploratory learning for pursuing these goals. Our illustrations use tasks embedded in contexts that teenagers can relate to, provide visual rewards for computational actions, use rich data‐contexts, and integrate statistical and computational thinking. They provide engaging introductions to modern data sourced from databases via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that are accessible to a broad range of students and facilitate student personalization for investigation. We provide in‐depth discussion of teaching strategies that heavily involve questioning and student tinkering supported by graphical‐user interfaces that enable students to interact with the data sources rapidly in multiple ways."
2a2cb07c011aea1d1bd8a9039a397f74dda95040,a call for a humanistic stance toward k data science education,"There is growing interest in how to better prepare K–12 students to work with data. In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data."

SIGMOD 2014 hosts an exciting technical program, with two keynote talks, by Maurice Herlihy (Brown University) and Eric Sedlar (Oracle Labs); a panel session on ""Should we all be teaching 'Intro to Data Science' instead of 'Intro to Databases'?,"" by Bill Howe (University of Washington), Michael Franklin (University of California, Berkeley), Juliana Freire (New York University), James Frew (University of California, Santa Barbara), Tim Kraska (Brown University), and Raghu Ramakrishnan (Microsoft Corporation); an industrial panel on ""Are We Experiencing a Big Data Bubble?,"" by Fatma Ozcan (IBM Almaden Research Center), Daniel Abadi (Yale University), Marcel Kornacker (Cloudera), C Mohan (IBM Almaden Research Center), Karthik Ramasamy (Twitter), and Janet Wiener (Facebook, Inc. ); 107 research paper presentations; 6 tutorials; 30 demonstrations; and 15 industrial presentations selected from among 44 submissions. In addition to having 25-minute presentation slots, research papers are included in one of two Research Plenary Poster Sessions. One of these sessions is jointly for PODS and SIGMOD research papers, to deepen the ties between the two conferences. 
 
SIGMOD 2014 includes several technical and social events designed specifically for student attendees. The SIGMOD/PODS 2014 Ph.D. Symposium, the Undergraduate Research Poster Competition, and the New Researcher Symposium are all established components of the SIGMOD program and are all part of SIGMOD 2014. The conference also hosts a session dedicated to highlighting the finalists of the SIGMOD Programming Contest. (This year's task is to implement a multidimensional, high-throughput, in-memory indexing system.) In addition, the conference includes a Sponsor Session for our industry partners to present the cool things they have done and introduce career opportunities in industry. This helps bring student attendees together with our Gold, Platinum, and Diamond sponsors. A ""vis-a-vis"" meeting aimed at helping Ph.D. students meet internationally recognized researchers in their research areas, will also be organized to exchange ideas and receive guidance in a relaxed social setting. 
 
We are immensely grateful to the many researchers who have shaped the conference program. In particular, we thank the Keynotes Chair Gustavo Alonso (ETH Zurich), the Panels Chairs Susan Davidson (University of Pennsylvania) and Sunita Sarawagi (IIT Bombay), the Tutorial Chairs Chris Jermaine (Rice University) and Yufei Tao (Chinese University of Hong Kong), the Industrial Program Chairs Fatma Ozcan (IBM Almaden) and Nesime Tatbul (Intel Labs and MIT), together with the 13 members of the Industrial Program Committee, the Demonstrations Chairs Wolfgang Lehner (Technische Universitat Dresden) and Bettina Kemme (McGill University), together with the 53 members of the Demonstration Program Committee, the Workshops Chair Anastasia Ailamaki (EPFL), the Undergraduate Research Program Chairs Mario Nascimento (University of Alberta) and Anastasios Kementsietsidis (IBM TJ Watson Laboratories), the New Researcher Symposium Chairs Anish Das Sarma (Google Research) and Alexandra Meliou (University of Massachusetts, Amherst).

This year we had two submission cycles for SIGMOD research papers -- one in mid-September and the second one in mid-December. We received 421 research paper submissions across two cycles. As usual, each paper was reviewed by at least three program committee members, followed by a discussion led by the area coordinators. We followed a review process that resembles journal reviewing -- papers went through multiple rounds of reviews until a final decision was taken. Out of 421 submissions, 29 were directly accepted, 102 went through a major revision process, and 290 were rejected. Out of the 102 that went through a major revision 56 were accepted, a further 22 were accepted following a third round of ""minor revisions,"" and 24 were rejected. Since the review process resembled journal-style, the acceptance rates are also similar to top journals. 
 
We also acknowledge all members of the SIGMOD 2014 organizing committee, as well as the SIGMOD Executive Committee, for invaluable help and guidance throughout the many months leading to the conference. The strong organizing team for SIGMOD 2014 includes proceedings chairs Xiang Lian (University of Texas - Pan American) and Florin Rusu (University of California Merced), finance chair Nikolaus Augsten (University of Salzburg), publicity chairs Guoliang Li (Tsinghua University) and Ashwin Machanavajjhala (Duke University), social media chair Ming Hua (Facebook), sponsorship chairs Yi Chen (New Jersey Institute of Technology) and Nick Koudas (University of Toronto), exhibit chairs Rui Zhang (University of Melbourne) and Peixiang Zhao (Florida State University), local arrangements chair Ryan Johnson (University of Toronto), registration chairs Tingjian Ge (University of Massachusetts, Lowell) and Gabriel Ghinita (University of Massachusetts, Boston), demonstration and workshop local arrangement chair Jeff Phillips (University of Utah), web chairs Huiping Cao (New Mexico State University) and Bin Yao (Shanghai Jiao Tong University), travel award committee chairs Alexandra Meliou (University of Massachusetts, Amherst) and Cong Yu (Google Research), and programming contest chairs Sam Madden (MIT) and Jeong-Hyon Hwang (University of Albany).

This study proposes the creation of a virtual environment by means of the FreeDFD simulator, flipped classroom and YouTube videos with the purpose of linking the theoretical topics in the Logical of Predicates Unit with the field of computer science. The variables related to the teaching-learning process are Efficiency (assimilation of knowledge) and Technical Quality (Bloom’s Taxonomy: Memory, Comprehension and Application). On the other hand, students’ perception is analyzed through the Quality of service (teaching-learning process, technological ability and mathematical ability) and Customer satisfaction (utility, benefits and need). By means of data mining (decision trees technique), this research identifies four predictive models on assimilation of knowledge considering Bloom’s Taxonomy. The results obtained from linear regression (machine learning with 50% training and 50% evaluation) indicate that the Juran’s methodology facilitates the construction of virtual educational spaces through the stages related to the identification of clients, establishment of customer needs, translation of needs into the language of the organization, development of the product or service, creation of a process and transfer of the process to the operation. In conclusion, universities should improve educational conditions considering aspects of the technology, flipped classroom and continuous improvement."

Big data firms, such as Google and Facebook, identified this problem several years ago and are continuously developing new technologies or improving existing technologies in order to facilitate the cognitive analysis process of these large data sets. The purpose of this article is to contribute to our theoretical understanding of the role that big data might play in creating new training opportunities for South African universities. The article investigates emerging literature on the characteristics and main components of big data, together with the Hadoop application stack as an example of big data technology. Due to the rapid development of big data technology, a paradigm shift of human resources is required to analyse these data sets; therefore, this study examines the state of big data teaching at South African universities. This article also provides an overview of possible big data sources for South African universities, as well as relevant big data skills that data scientists need. The study also investigates existing academic programs in South Africa, where the focus is on teaching advanced database systems. The study found that big data and data science topics are introduced to students on a postgraduate level, but that the scope is very limited. This article contributes by proposing important theoretical topics that could be introduced as part of the existing academic programs. More research is required, however, to expand these programs in order to meet the growing demand for data scientists with big data skills."

One approach involves teaching data science concepts through an online education platform. We designed a think-aloud experiment in which we observed seven internal medicine residents complete an online interactive lesson using the Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE). The hour-long lesson focused on the predictive modeling lifecycle. Participants’ verbalizations and structured interactions with the platform were recorded. We observed a surprising misunderstanding of the lesson’s three main data science concepts. We also noticed a willingness to spend more time on familiar concepts and a comparative disengagement when seeing new topics. Many are amenable to the idea of learning data science through an online forum. However, it is important to first consult prospective clinician users prior to designing lessons to ensure that lessons align with clinical backgrounds, expectations and just-in-time learning needs."

We touch on existing working concepts in machine learning didactics, what methods present initiatives use and cover open teaching resources available to date. With this, we hope to provide a starting point for future collaborations on this central topic given the expanding use of machine learning in science, industry and our daily lives. 1. Teaching Machine Learning workshop 2020 Many experts and practitioners who develop Machine Learning models or infrastructure around these models are confronted with the opportunity (or duty) to teach Machine Learning (ML) at some point in their career. Traditionally, many rely on their gut feeling to design courses that are motivated by these circumstances. The methods to design such material are often large collections of PowerPoint slides to convey the content and in-class interactive question and answer sessions. At the virtual Teaching Machine Learning Workshop at ECML-PKDD 2020 (https://teaching-ml. github.io/2020/) targetted those who would like to know, how teachers from around the globe approach teaching ML. We hoped that all participants obtain a better feeling where they stand with their teaching and how they can Equal contribution Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf Helmhotz Zentrum München University of Applied Science (HTW) Dresden, Germany.

Related to this, we expected for this workshop to be a beginning of an effort towards improved frameworks for ML literacy and competency. Eleven speakers presented their ideas on teaching ML (videos available under https://youtu.be/ qGYGhpwG9iI). Afterwards three breakout groups were formed to discuss three topics in-depth, the outcomes of which form the remainder of this article: Education research (Section 2), learning from others (Section 3), and open materials for teaching (Section 4). 2. What do we know about good ML teaching? Machine learners believe in data and in using them to get a better understanding of the world. Does this also hold when it comes to their own teaching and education practice (similar to Gelman & Loken)? Data and research on what good ML education means is hardly available. Already in 2017 Amy J. Ko proclaimed that “We need to learn how to teach machine learning” in her insightful blog post on the topic. She argues that pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) about ML – such as “Effective analogies, examples, and explanations of machine learning” or “Knowledge of which concepts in machine learning are difficult and why”– is missing. In her workshop talk Rebecca Fiebrink added “Why teach this subject?” (see Grossman, 1990), “What should be taught?”, and “How can/should technology be used in this teaching?” (see Mishra & Koehler, 2006) to the list of missing PCKs. She also showed a few examples of what research on ML education can look like. Fiebrink defines clear learning objectives (based on the theory of constructive alignment, see Biggs, 2003) and then tests her students to check if her teaching actually lead the students to reach these objectives. In one example she tested the learning objectives • LO1: Understand the structure of supervised learning problems and capability of supervised learning algorithms • LO2: Identify feasible uses of ML in new projects, and map a new project idea onto the structure of supervised learning (input, output, training data, model) Teaching Machine Learning in 2020 by asking the students to “brainstorm a list of scenarios in which supervised learning could be used to make a piece of interactive art or music”. 27 of the ideas students brought forward were feasible. However, 21 out of these 27 ideas were found solvable with programming only. They did not appear to necessarily require ML. This observations provides hints that concepts in ML are difficult to learn (see PCKs in Ko, 2017) and are potentially picked up unreflected with respect to the capabilities of ML in practice. In the workshop’s breakout group on Education Research, we discussed what would be needed to get research on ML education started. We collected related ressources, e.g. research on statistics and computer science education as well as on competence and literacy models in data literacy and computer science literacy (see Ziegler & Garfield, 2018; Chance et al., 2018; Guzdial, 2019). In the short time given we compiled a draft for a competence definition in ML: Everyday literacy (Knowledge based on personal and communal experience) • What is ML? What does it have to do with AI? • What do the buzz words (big data, AI, ...) mean? • What can ML do? What can it not do (or is not useful for)? What is ML used for in practice? • Can ML be helpful for my problem/my data? • What are good/useful data? What are potential data problems? (Questioning data) • What are ethical issues of ML? Applied literacy (Skill-based Literacy: Using a specific skill of know-how, based on acquired expertise) • How to apply ML in practice with data? • How to make decisions based on data / ML results? • What are the key concepts of ML • What is supervised / unsupervised ML and how do the differ? • What are the algorithms / methods that form the basis of ML? • How to evaluate ML models (cross-validation, measures, etc.)? • How to run ML pipelines on the computer? Theoretical literacy (Disciplinary knowledge) • What is the mathematical, statistical and computational background of the methods? • What are connections between different concepts/methods? • What are open questions in ML research? • How to adapt and implement algorithms in code? Reflexive Literacy (Probing assumed and specialized knowledge systems) • What is the reason for (not) ML? • What are limitations of ML/methods? • When does what (not) work? • What is the effect of ML/research on society? • What are the responsibilities of a machine learner? This draft can be used as a basis for upcoming research on ML literacy and learning. 3. Learning from other teachers Teaching material for ML has existed as long as ML was conceived to be useful to find patterns in data. In this role, it remained a highly academic topic for very long. With this, the audience being taught were mostly applied mathematicians, statisticians and advanced domain scientists. With the abundant availablity of data and compute resources and the subsequent renaissance of ML (marked by (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Dahl et al., 2014) and others), the use of ML has also expanded to new audiences, e.g. software engineers (Howard & Gugger, 2020), artists (Fiebrink, 2020) or children and teenagers (Touretzky et al., 2019). With that, the requirements and goals of classical ML teaching content have gone beyond traditional limits. This spurrs the question, what ML teachers can learn from others? 3.1. Data Science Curricula New and scalable approaches to teaching data science (as a prerequisite to ML) have been implemented (Teal et al., 2015) and made available as open-source. These lessons were made subject to data quality studies based on preand post-workshop surveys which showed substantial positive effects on the learning outcome (Jordan, 2016). With this, the carpentries exposes a primary community to draw experiences from. Among others, four main aspects of carpentries’ style teaching were identified to be most informative to ML instructors: Know your learners As (Wilson, 2014) indicates, learners (of ML) today come with a heterogenous mixture of learning backgrounds, identies and facilities. Knowing better these details before a workshop by means of preworkshop surveys was found to be most instrumental. Especially with regards to the mathematical demands for learning ML, this can be readily adopted to ML. Stay close to applications Learners invest considerable mental effort to improve their ML skills at workshops. In order to lower this investment, (Teal et al., 2015), (GarciaAlgarra, 2020) and (Wilson, 2014) use sandbox data to Teaching Machine Learning in 2020 demonstrate and elaborate on pedagogical content which is inherently close to the learners domain or is easy to grasp. This minimizes the mental load on learners to first understand what to expect from the data and thus aids the learning process. Live coding Popularized by (Wilson, 2014), live coding brings certain benefits to teaching complex topics programmatically. This offers benefits to reduce the teaching speed, watching code and results slowly emerge in contrast to having to understand readymade slides, fosters lateral knowledge transfer (seeing instructors fix problems or comment on questions immediately). While this is considered productive for content that aims to convey mechanistic knowledge, it has to be seen if this can aid at all the deeper understanding of mathematical cause and effects of ML systems. Teach math/code without computers Aside from the focus on math and code for teaching ML, an ever growing part of the community motivates aspects of ML aside of these fields in curricula. As (Huppenkothen & Eadie, 2020) stresses, non-coding or non-math material can readily be used to teach learners important aspects of the supervised ML workflow starting from unbiased data taking, choosing features and being aware what a loss given these features optimizes for. Especially the latter can quickly lead learners to discussions of ethi"

In this talk, I'll share my observations on this evolving ecosystem, including: • Estimates of the number of R users • The R Community: people sharing R software and experiences • How R is being used in academia and in industry • R's role in the Data Science movement • How R is bringing modern Statistics to business applications The talk will conclude with some thoughts on what the future holds for R's role in the worlds of statistics, data science, and business."
82f121934a64e80f2b57076e09b464e95d25710b,roles for health sciences librarians at college and university libraries,"ABSTRACT 
  
Objectives: To meet the changing priorities of researchers and funding agencies, U.S. college and university libraries (C&ULs) that are not Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL) members may want to hire librarians capable of supporting interdisciplinary health sciences research. This study sought to identify whether such roles are emerging by examining advertised position descriptions. 
  
Methods: We collected position advertisements posted to job boards and mailing lists between September 1 2018 and March 1 2019. Positions that included one of these terms in the title, qualifications, or responsibilities were eligible for inclusion: medic*, health, life, nursing, veterinary, bio*, pharma*. We categorized postings by institution type, geographic region, and position type. We used grounded theory to identify themes within the data, and NVivo to quantify how often each theme appeared within the data. 
  
Results: 104 job postings met our inclusion criteria: 60 at AAHSL institutions and 44 at C&UL institutions. Despite some minor variations among specific roles and responsibilities, we found substantial overlap in the qualifications listed for positions at both types of institution. Qualifications more often prioritized traditional librarian competencies rather than emerging areas, such as data science, grant support, and research impact.  
  
Conclusions: Both AAHSL and C&UL institutions show an interest in hiring librarians capable of supporting health and life sciences teaching and research. Competition for a similar pool of applicants may create challenges for hiring officials, and librarians interested in these positions will likely seek out professional development opportunities in emerging areas of practice."

3309f5454600d778d3236a6936427e9a43ddc212,teaching data science to medical trainees,"Data science broadly refers to the endeavour of extracting knowledge from data. There is currently an explosion of data in health care, from the use of electronic health care record systems to complex datasets such as genomics. These scenarios present tremendous opportunities for health professionals— including doctors, nurses, medical students and allied health staff— to innovate their practice by harnessing, analysing and extracting insights from data. Furthermore, understanding data science will allow health professionals to be critical users of the literature. Reflecting the need for future doctors to be familiar with data science methods, our university (University College London) recently introduced a module titled ‘Doctor As Data Scientist’. This programme aims to educate medical students about critical appraisal and data science in medicine, and there are calls for more universities to implement a similar approach.1 There is also an increasing demand amongst medical students for data science skills to be incorporated into their training.2 However, several challenges remain in teaching data science to medical students:"
53cec49af2bf551169ccb50a12830b0dc90c94d8,teaching programming skills in methods courses is an opportunity not a burden,"As political scientists have become more skilled in the tools of computational social science, we have begun to pass these skills on to our undergraduate students. Students in undergraduate quantitative methods courses today often learn to program in statistical software alongside the more traditional topics of mathematics and research design. Many undergraduates are eager to learn these skills due to their desirability in increasingly common data science jobs. An equally large number of undergraduates may harbor anxieties about having to “learn to code” for the first time, especially in departments in which completing a quantitative methods course is a required component of the degree. These concerns are especially pronounced for students who belong to groups that historically have been excluded from science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.1 Some faculty may feel that teaching programming skills detracts from the social scientific goals of a course, and they prefer to use point-and-click software such as Stata and SPSS to avoid this instructional burden. However, teaching programming with tools such as the R statistical computing environment represents an opportunity for instructors to cultivate a more engaging classroom experience for students. Understanding statistical concepts can be a time-consuming process with a steep learning curve, but computing skills provide students with a succession of smaller, more easily attainable victories that can build confidence and maintain engagement with conceptual material. This approach can help students fromhistorically excluded groups gain the confidence to pursue subjects that they may not have otherwise, and it gives more advanced students the opportunity to learn by teaching their peers."

Particular aspects that are the focus in this paper include: teaching programming through a sequence of common patterns/idioms for data exploration and analysis, rather than in the language-feature focus that is traditional in programming classes; read-then-write-until-correct presentation for each pattern; explicit presentation of a notional machine for execution, in stages as more language complexity is experienced; starting with core Python before then covering use of libraries such as pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn."

cb27e5770ee0ba5d54bd19bb3561f2ce58075578,collaborative peer feedback and learning analytics theoryoriented design for supporting classwide interventions,"Abstract Although dialogue can augment the impact of feedback on student learning, dialogic feedback is unaffordable by instructors teaching large classes. In this regard, peer feedback can offer a scalable and effective solution. However, the existing practices optimistically rely on students’ discussion about feedback and lack a systematic design approach. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework of collaborative peer feedback which structures feedback dialogue into three distinct phases and outlines the learning processes involved in each of them. Then, we present a web-based platform, called Synergy, which is designed to facilitate collaborative peer feedback as conceptualised in the theoretical framework. To enable instructor support and facilitation during the feedback practice, we propose a learning analytics support integrated into Synergy. The consolidated model of learning analytics, which concerns three critical pieces for creating impactful learning analytics practices, theory, design and data science, was employed to build the analytics support. The learning analytics support aims to guide instructors’ class-wide actions toward improving students’ learning experiences during the three phases of peer feedback. The actionable insights that the learning analytics support offers are discussed with examples."

f90a8c412638608714d85478431569f44c93a8cc,when one size does fit all simultaneous delivery of statistics teaching to multiple audiences,"In 2019, The Open University celebrated its 50th anniversary. For most of its fifty years it has been delivering statistics education to both specialists and non-specialists, simultaneously and at scale. A single module must deliver statistics teaching across multiple qualifications in many different disciplines which means it is not possible to tailor module material and examples for each individual qualification. This is contrary to the way many service teaching modules are designed. For example, the introductory statistics module at The Open University delivers basic statistics and probability to around 1500 students a year. By structuring the material around topics to which everyone can relate; money, education and health, the module is able to engage students across a range of different qualifications from mathematics to economics, business studies, computing and natural sciences. Feedback from students has been overwhelmingly positive. Students are provided with printed material, which is supplemented with a variety of interactive elements, which will be described in this paper. Online forums provide a place for peer support. Small group tutorials, both face to face and online, are provided by tutors. Each tutor will typically support 20 students and provide feedback to those students on their assessable work. The students in an individual tutor’s group could be studying one of many different qualifications. All the module material, including all the interactive elements, are embedded in the university’s virtual learning environment which has made it possible to monitor how students engage with the material. This knowledge, and qualitative feedback from students, has provided support for the idea that by teaching through a narrative approach, with examples based on scenarios which have a broad interest to everyone, it is possible to engage all students with statistics regardless of their qualification. By taking this same narrative approach a new module is being created which will be studied concurrently by students in the final stages of their qualifications in mathematics, statistics, data science and economics. This paper will outline how the module will utilize Jupyter notebooks to deliver practical modelling with real data sets chosen to be of interest to all the different cohorts of students. During the last 50 years The Open University has always had to deliver modules at scale to students across many disciplines. With the increased use of data across qualifications, and the need for people to upskill in data analysis, it is essential to explore ways in which statistical training can be delivered at scale."

It practices that the goal of computing is insight (from graphical presentations) rather than numbers (especially accurate numbers which can be suboptimal (right answer to wrong question)). Our extensive theory simultaneously extends and integrates traditional (classical) statistical methods, treats multivariate discrete and continuous variables, parametric and nonparametric modeling, classication and measuring dependence relationships of ( X;Y ) where X can be a high dimensional vector of features and Y a scalar variable to predict or classify. The goal of this paper is to gently introduce many basic concepts: quantile; mid-distribution; mid-quantile; comparison density; comparison distribution; skew-G distribution; LP coecients, moments, co-moments; orthonormal score functions series density estimation; custom construction of mid-distribution based score functions; comparison probability version of Bayes theorem; copula density function series nonparametric estimation.

Increasingly, we can give rapid, individualized feedback for a wide range of problems, including engineering design problems and free-form text answers, as well as provide rich analytics that can be used to improve both teaching and learning. Data science and integration of data from disparate sources allows for increasingly inexpensive and accurate micro-assessments, such as those of open-ended textual responses, as well as estimation of higher-level skills that lead to long-term student success."
e1c7b238abeff55124a67cd31584e962c935bb51,statistical meaningfulness teaching craft and writing about teaching statistics and data science,"In this issue we celebrate the awarding of three prizes for papers on good practice in teaching statistics and data science: the C Oswald George prize for best paper in Teaching Statistics issues 1 to 3 in 2021; the Peter Holmes prize for highlighting excellence in motivating practical classroom activity in these issues; and the Teaching Statistics Trust prize for best paper in the 2021 special issue on Teaching Data Science and Statistics. The announcements and citations for these three papers may be found in this issue. These papers significantly add to the demonstration of the work across the world in developing, implementing, sustaining and researching good practice in teaching statistics and data science, and this issue also includes editorial thanks and appreciation to all who contribute to the writing on such good practice authors, reviewers, the Teaching Statistics Trust and publisher Wiley. There is substantial need for, and considerable appreciation of, more writing of high standard on good practice in teaching statistics and data science. Full text downloads of papers in Teaching Statistics increased by approximately 30% from 2016 to 2020, but increased again by more than 33% in just the first 10 months of 2021 with the addition of the special issue. There is also need for a substantial cultural shift with greater acknowledgement and respect for the skills and expertise required for good teaching of statistics and data science in and across all disciplines, especially foundation and introductory, and for creditable and refereed writing on good practice in such teaching in its development, implementation, sustainment, evaluation and research. Hence there is need for understanding of both what constitutes good practice in teaching statistics and data science, and what constitutes good writing and researching such practice. Although there has been much discussion over the past three decades on the former, this discussion must be ongoing and constantly evolve to reflect the constantly evolving and dynamic nature of statistics and data science as they develop diverse capabilities (methodological, conceptual, and technological) to tackle increasingly complex and large problems in wideranging real contexts. Clearly the first requirement of the latter is that it must be about good practice in the teaching. However it should also satisfy criteria of scholarly writing but appropriate for the very large community of all those who teach statistics and data science. In the interests of reader convenience, I am now going to use the word “statistics” instead of “statistics and data science” to include everything to do with thought, endeavours and professional practice involving chance, variation and data, without attempting to describe any internal or external possible “boundaries”. There has been much emphasis over many decades that good statistics teaching must reflect the good practice of statistics, but the parallels between the two are far deeper and more complex than just a reflection. Recent and current data science fervour has led to an increase in speaking and writing by leading statisticians about the professional practice of statistics, often building on wise words from the past, such as Tukey [4], and also commenting on leadership in the profession and its practice. In researching leadership in statistics, in response to some recent requests, I was struck by the parallels between what statisticians wrote about leadership in the practice of statistics, and what I had observed over many years of what constitutes leadership in good practice in teaching statistics. Here, however, I want to focus on the challenges and critical importance of good writing about good practice in teaching statistics. To enable the ongoing development and, crucially, sustainable implementation of the latter we need much more of the former, and wider and higher acknowledgement of the former by higher I mean by higher authorities and by leaders. We instantly have the problem of this word “good”. The word “good” does not have to be used as much in speaking of research and research literature because standards and criteria relevant to each research field have grown and become established; if they are debated even if vehemently so the debate has a reference framework. This is similar to the principle that it is more productive to bring at least some framework of propositions or plans to a meeting. Most research journals “belong” to professional societies, and many in statistics have put considerable effort into work to develop and sustain applied sections of their journals, as well as high quality reviews and DOI: 10.1111/test.12300"

Through the mining and analysis of large-scale data education information, it is of great significance to comprehensively understand information and the construction of computer science laboratory. In order to accelerate the process of laboratory digitalization, it is necessary to continuously integrate and optimize the teaching structure and teaching operating system, so as to further improve the data processing and analysis ability of information and computing science laboratory. At the same time, in the construction of information and computing science laboratory, experimental teaching as an important part of college teaching, there will be a large number of data types in the operation and use of the laboratory, and the use of data mining technology to obtain valuable data information as an important indicator of laboratory construction. At the same time, data mining technology provides powerful technical support for information and computing science laboratory. Data information processing is the process of standardizing the teaching data obtained in the previous step. Data formats obtained from experimental software platforms or other systems often cannot meet the requirements of mining, such as data missing or useless, the format conversion of original teaching data is carried out according to the standard requirements of data mining algorithm. This paper further promotes the integration and innovation of information computing science major through the application of data mining technology in big data science technology."
d3c6c7d19fc75902f6f6e675e33c4d6bbd05e845,thanks to all,"Thank you to Teaching Statistics Trust members, editorial board members, reviewers, authors and readers of this unique and important journal. For everyone involved with teaching, whether at school, tertiary or in the workplace, the past two years have been challenging. I particularly extend deep gratitude to all our reviewers who put so much thought and effort into this very important professional work which often does not receive the appreciation from authorities that it should. The effects and influences of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid 19) on society and on teaching, as well as the increasing work to further learning in statistics and data science, have been reflected in the admirable efforts, initiatives and thinking of authors. I particularly wish to thank everyone involved in the special issue published in 2021, Teaching Data Science and Statistics: foundation and introductory. The success of the excellent work by authors and reviewers is evidenced by the many downloads and enquiries. My coeditors Jim Ridgway and Rob Gould were outstanding in all aspects of their work. It is not easy to develop and implement good practice in teaching statistics and data science, nor is it easy to write well and meet scholarly writing standards about it. But these efforts are some of the most important in education, particularly at foundation and introductory levels across all disciplines, and the challenges are also opportunities to further this work. Best wishes for 2022 and keep contributing to inspiring, teaching and writing about best practices in our International Journal for Statistics and Data Science Teaching."
104749f0861a1abec0d23df9e6c0a6f92e31d6be,xiaoshih the educational intelligent question answering bot on chinesebased moocs,"In this study, the educational intelligent question answering bot named Xiao-Shih has been developed for solving learners' questions as instructors and teaching assistants on MOOCs. Experiments were conducted with Xiao-Shih in a paid course titled ""Python for Data Science"" on ""ShareCourse"" which is one of the largest Chinese-based MOOC platform in Taiwan. Over one thousand discussion threads posted in both English and Chinese languages were retrieved to train the bot by natural language processing (NLP) and Random Forest (RF) in machine learning algorithms. This paper presents the implementation details on developing Xiao-Shih. First, we developed an initial version of Xiao-Shih with simply NLP techniques and text similarity approaches. However, Xiao-Shih only obtains 0.413 precision at best with different thresholds of the question similarity. Therefore, features and labels of answering correctness have been collected for the next version of Xiao-Shih. Trained by Random Forest with 70% of the entire dataset, Xiao-Shih obtains 0.833 precision with test dataset. With this educational intelligent question answering bot, learners can solve their problems immediately in seconds rather than wait for humans' response in hours even days. Moreover, Xiao-Shih can also ease instructors' and teaching assistants' burden on answering questions."

Thanks to recent advances, FHE has become feasible for a wide range of applications, resulting in an explosion of interest in the topic and ground-breaking real-world deployments. Given the increasing presence of FHE beyond the core academic community, there is increasing demand for easier access to FHE for wider audiences. Efficient implementations of FHE schemes are mostly written in high-performance languages like C++, posing a high entry barrier to novice users. We need to bring FHE to the (higher-level) languages and ecosystems non-experts are already familiar with, such as Python, the de-facto standard language of data science and machine learning. We achieve this through wrapping existing FHE implementations in Python, providing one-click installation and convenience in addition to a significantly higher-level API. In contrast to other similar works, Pyfhel goes beyond merely exposing the underlying API, adding a carefully designed abstraction layer that feels at home in Python. In this paper, we present Pyfhel, introduce its design and usage, and highlight how its unique support for accessing low-level features through a high-level API makes it an ideal teaching tool for lectures on FHE."

On the one hand students learn the usefulness and benefits of this technique for different scientific purposes like user evaluation to find design flaws or visual attention strategies, gaze-assisted interaction to enhance and augment traditional interaction techniques, or as a means to improve virtual reality experiences. However, on the other hand, the large amount of recorded data means a challenge for data analytics in order to find rules, patterns, but also anomalies in the data, finally leading to insights and knowledge to understand or predict eye movement patterns which can have synergy effects for both disciplines - eye tracking and visual analytics. In this paper we will describe the challenges of teaching eye tracking combined with visual analytics in a computer and data science bachelor course with 42 students in an active learning scenario following four teaching stages. Some of the student project results are shown to demonstrate learning outcomes with respect to eye tracking data analysis and visual analytics techniques."

Education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. However, when a student in a physical classroom he can ask questions from the instructor and reduce their stickiness. In addition, the instructor can easily identify if the student understands the lesson or not. But when it comes to the E-learning platforms identifying student satisfaction is challenging. In most E-learning platforms, there are discussion forums to ask questions. However, there is no proper way to identify each student’s problems, satisfaction with the lesson as a physical classroom. So this is the main issue here the authors identified in this research. Therefore, to avoid students' stickiness and improve the satisfaction in E-learning platforms here authors suggest a student satisfaction monitoring system for courses or the live sessions. For this here, the authors suggest a Data science approach-based solution. Here in the authors' solution, there are three main components combined to monitor student satisfaction. They are facial expression identifier, Speech analyzer, and the students' browser history analyzing component while in the lecturer. By these three components here, this application is able to analyze whether the student is satisfied with the lecture. The main goal of the author of this research is to increase student satisfaction by notifying each student’s satisfaction with the lecturer or the course owner"
c74fbe3e112cce8d4e8042e119ef706389a74d18,impact of the web application for the educational process on the compound interest considering data science,"This quantitative research analyzes the impact of the Web Application for the Educational Process on Compound Interest (WAEPCI) considering the machine learning and data science. The sample is composed of 46 students who studied the Financial Mathematics course in a Mexican university during the 2017 school year. WAEPCI presents the calculation of the Compound Interest and Compound Amount over a period of four years through the data simulation. The results of the machine learning (linear regression) indicate that WAEPCI positively influences the assimilation of knowledge and development of mathematical skills on the Compound Interest and Compound Amount. Data science establishes 4 predictive models on the use of WAEPCI in the educational process by means of the decision tree technique. The construction of web applications facilitates the active role of students, improves the assimilation of knowledge and allows the development of skills. Finally, WAEPCI improves the teaching-learning conditions on Financial Mathematics through the data simulation."
42cfbf1e68f0db6802fb1944506b004d269073da,integrating the use of statistical software into undergraduate political methodology courses,"It is widely recognized that statistical, programming, data science, and analytic skills give students a strategic advantage on the job market and in their future career. The American Statistical Association predicted that by 2021, 70% of business leaders will prefer candidates with data science skills.1 This demand is expected to keep growing, with projections of 28% growth during the last five years.2 Jobs that require coding skills pay, on average, $22,000 more per year than those that do not, and almost half of all jobs payingmore than $58,000 require at least some level of coding.3 In acknowledgment of this trend, higher education has added degrees, programs, and courses in data science and emphasized a greater need for data literacy among students.4 Students also are recognizing the utility of these skills because they now are often requirements for jobs beyond the business or physical science world, including education, healthcare, nonprofits, and even the wine industry.5 Yet, for our discipline, teaching undergraduate political methodology courses remains a demanding task; faculty must instruct students to bewriters, readers, and creators of political knowledge.6 Although these courses have existed for decades, the growing emphasis on data analysis and data literacy places a greater demand on research methods courses to deliver these skills. To further complicate the situation, there is little common discussion among political scientists regarding the use of data software, skills, and approaches in these courses. As a discipline, although we recognize the growing need for greater data literacy among undergraduate students, we appear to have placed little emphasis on this trend in our own pedagogical discussions. The criticism that research methodology lacks a strong pedagogical founding is not new. Previous studies recognize a dearth of discussion on the subject, despite acknowledging that methods courses often are some of the most academically challenging for students (Howard and Brady 2015). For instance, Wagner, Garner, and Kawulich (2011, 75) stated that research methods instructors “appear not to cover pedagogical questions at all.” This does not mean that discussions of pedagogy in social science and political science methodology are nonexistent (c.f. Hubbell 1994; Nind, Kilburn, and Luff 2015; Payne and Williams 2011). However, the fact remains that there is little guidance for undergraduate political methodology instructors. As more students recognize the benefits of these courses, a deeper understanding of best practices in pedagogical approaches is urgently needed. This article fills this void by addressing two questions: (1) How is statistical software incorporated into undergraduate political methodology courses?; and (2) How are these courses structured and taught? We answer these questions through two distinct approaches. First, a team of research assistants collected and coded course information from 93 syllabi from 78 separate institutions (some had two or more syllabi included) of undergraduate political methodology courses drawn from a cross section of institutions according to their rank in the US News & World Report (Brown, Bryant, and Philips 2021). Of the 93 syllabi, 25 were from the South, 24 from the North, 9 from the East, and 35 from the West. Second, we relied on an anonymous survey conducted in January 2021—advertised on both the PolMeth email listserv and the “Political Scientists” private group page on Facebook —of instructors who have taught a political methodology course at the undergraduate level. We received more than 140 responses, from a mix of R1 (53% of respondents), R2 (11%), and R3 institutions (9%), as well as liberal arts (26%) and community colleges (0.7%). Using these two original data sources, we provide a broad overview of the “state of the discipline” regarding not only how statistical software is incorporated into political methodology courses but also how it is presented to students. We conclude with advice for instructors of these courses."
94aea98b76f7c463cadf27cb73377445b3b8415f,introducing big data analytics in high school and college,"In this teaching tip and courseware note we describe a series of hands on activities and exercises that we've used to introduce the notion of big data analytics to a wide range of audience. These exercises range in complexity from a paper and pencil thought exercise, to using Google Trends for simple explorations, to using a spread sheet to simulate the iterative nature of Google's PageRank algorithm, to programming with a Python based map-reduce framework. These exercises have been used in courses to train high school teachers in data science, full semester university courses (undergraduate and graduate), and CS education outreach efforts. Feedback has been positive as to their efficacy."

The sample is composed of 42 students of the careers in Administration and Marketing who attended the Financial Mathematics course during the 2018 school year. The ADDIE model allows organizing the construction of the WATLSD through the stages of Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. The results of machine learning indicate that the use of the WATLSD during the learning process positively influences the motivation, active role and development of mathematical skills. Likewise, data science establishes 3 predictive models on the use of the WATLSD in the educational field. Finally, advances in technology such as the WATLSD allow the creation of new virtual spaces for learning and teaching."
afb5f27d7b51a5c6e7456b45c0e50bc5281fa8a1,teaching statistics trust prize for special issue,"Teaching Statistics are happy to announce that the Teaching Statistics Trust has awarded a prize for the best paper in the 2021 special issue, Teaching Data Science and Statistics: foundation and introductory, to Anna Fergusson and Chris Wild for their paper On traversing the data landscape: Introducing APIs to data-science students. Statistics and data science and their teaching are intrinsically linked. This is seen not only in the increasing inclusion of technology in teaching statistics, but also in the data and contexts considered, and the broadening of statistical issues, explorations, presentations, and discussions at introductory levels, whether school, undergraduate or postgraduate/workplace in other disciplines. The intent of the special issue is to provide impetus and inspiration to all readers and authors in furthering this progress, and to celebrate the new subtitle of the journal, in the increasing awareness of what data science is, and how statistics and data science work together in tackling real and complex datasets and problems involving complex data. Data science is much more than a new set of tools it opens doors to whole new ways of thinking about information, explanation, and action, and the special issue demonstrates what an extraordinarily rich field this is and just how much challenge and opportunity there are that could, and should, be considered by the statistical and data science community. Amongst the excellent papers illustrating a wide variety of approaches and offering some very rich examples for teaching in this emerging space, the special issue editors, after much debate, chose the winning paper because of the importance of harvesting the vast amounts of data now available combined with authentic student engagement in enquiry-based learning in a fun and universally appealing context. The pedagogic approach is an excellent demonstration of the long-time advocacy of leading statisticians and statistical educators of students learning of technical tools and statistical thinking via graduated needs arising in the tackling of a real data investigation that piques student curiosity and exploration. The proposal, using APIs, is unique and cutting edge, but is explained in an extremely clear way. It centers on the importance of the data gathering phase in data science (at least when it comes to data scraping), and mastery of this skill not only empowers students, but teaches them that the internet really is just organized data. However such approaches cannot succeed without careful scaffolding, preparation and deep understanding of student needs in learning about data. Students move from immersion in a search activity (for photos) to URL hacking and GUIdriven tools, to thinking of variables and then to API’s. Graphical explorations are then encouraged to at least partially discuss some of the questions that have arisen during a student’s personal journey in the investigation. The approach is simple, well written, directly usable, asks questions students will engage with, and readers will tend to want to try out the activities for themselves. The activities described can be used across the curriculum and with a variety of age groups, and hacking APIs could appeal to a variety of students. As well as influencing curricula, statistics courses could use this approach as an extra project, or computer science classes could be enticed to pay more attention to data. Since its inception in 1979, Teaching Statistics has always aimed to emphasize good practice in teaching statistics and statistical thinking in any context. As long advocated by professional statisticians and leading statistical educators, good practice in teaching statistics should reflect the practice of statistics in the fullest sense, integrating the principles and practice of data investigations with statistical literacy in congruence with current statistical developments and usage in real world contexts and problems. Statistics has long been both a user and driver of computing technology, and to tackle increasingly vast amounts of data and progressively more complex problems in ever more diverse contexts, the statistical sciences have been rapidly developing, and been involved in, more and better methods and technologies. We congratulate the authors for their excellent paper, and congratulate all authors in the special issue for their valuable contributions to this critically important area of teaching data science and statistics."
f52185ca3824eefe48ad9f6635d280f77da9c6eb,teachers perception about moocs and ict during the covid pandemic,"Technological advances such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) allow the construction of new spaces where students consult the information at any time, take the online exams and communicate with the participants of the educational process from anywhere. This quantitative research analyzes the perception of the teachers about the organization of the school activities in MOOCs and use of ICT considering machine learning and decision tree techniques (data science). The participants are 122 teachers (58 men and 64 women) from the National Autonomous University of Mexico who took the “Innovation in University Teaching 2020” Diploma. The academic degree of these educators is Bachelor (n = 35, 28.69%), Specialty (n = 4, 3.28%), Master (n = 58, 47.54%) and Doctorate (n = 25, 20.49%). The results of machine learning (linear regressions) indicate that the organization of the school activities in MOOCs positively influences the motivation, participation and learning of the students. Data science identifies 3 predictive models about MOOCs and ICT through the decision tree technique. According to the teachers of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the organization of the school activities in MOOCs and use of ICT play a fundamental role during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implications of this research promotes that educators use MOOCs and ICT to improve the educational conditions, create new remote school activities and build new virtual learning spaces. In conclusion, universities with the support of technological tools can improve the teaching-learning process and update the course during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, MOOCs represent a technological alternative to transform the school activities in the 21st century. © 2022 by the authors."
86ed398193bd53dfa3358e9e1e36793fdce8022b,research and practice of teaching mode of big data acquisition and cleaning based on obe concept,"Big data acquisition and cleaning is the first part of big data processing, mainly to solve the problem of data sources and dirty data cleaning, to provide qualified data samples for the subsequent big data analysis and application. The course of Big data acquisition and cleaning is the first professional core course of data science and big data technology. The course has many difficult knowledge points, involves many tools and software, is closely integrated with the application, and requires the high practical ability of students, so it is impossible to achieve the teaching purpose by the traditional teaching method. In this paper, based on the OBE concept, the teaching content, teaching methods, and course assessment methods are reformed. From the point of view of the students’ learning effect and evaluation results, the course reform has achieved the desired effect."
ef64577077a9a372a7a3d4e48b7885863992176f,scaling up data literacy and computing skills training in biodiversity science lessons learned from the carpentries,"The expanding availability of access to data about museum specimens, species occurrences, trait data, genetics, and landscapes is revolutionizing biodiversity research. But mobilizing, evaluating, and synthesizing these data to address research questions requires domain-specific computing skills and knowledge.
 The Carpentries is a global non-profit organization teaching researchers computational and data science skills for data management and analysis in all domains of research. The Carpentries' teaching practices are based on evidence from the science of learning. Current domain-specific lessons include life, physical, and social sciences. Hands-on exercises build on the existing knowledge of learners, quickly enabling them to apply skills learned to their research. The Carpentries' train-the-trainer model, its globally established community of ~2,000 instructors and its network of regional coordinators have allowed the organization to scale up rapidly, and over 40,000 learners have participated in Carpentries workshops since 2012.
 The Carpentries assessment program evaluates the impact of attending a workshop on the participants' perception of their skills and confidence. After attending a Carpentries workshop, participants feel more confident in their ability to program and to overcome issues with their analysis. The Carpentries' mentoring program ensures that newly certified instructors receive support and guidance to successfully engage in leading and teaching workshops. Pairing new and experienced instructors, in combination with the development of local communities of instructors, have contributed to the success of The Carpentries workshops.
 The Carpentries collaboratively seeks to develop new curricula to address the training needs of the biodiversity data community. Establishing training partnerships between The Carpentries and the various organizations involved in building biodiversity data science skills capacity would increase reach and efficacy. We seek to foster institutional and organizational collaborations that can support the establishment and growth of the infrastructure needed to provide the computational and data literacy skills needed to empower our stakeholders. These include those creating and mobilizing data (e.g., collectors, ecologists, conservationists, curators, collection/data managers), for all scientists, policy-makers, educators, and students who want to use biodiversity data."

ca0a4da5e878e872a2cbbe8205f00256b09cd295,research on the classified teaching and evaluation mode of computer organization,"It is common for universities to offer the same course in different majors, but using same teaching content and evaluation method for the same course in different majors is not conducive to the professional development of students. In this paper, we take computer organization course for example, which is open to students from three majors in our university, including computer science and technology, data science and big data, and cyberspace security. We customize classified teaching contents, design differentiated practical projects, and adopt diversified multi-dimensional evaluation schemes according to the characteristic of three different majors. It is expected to effectively improve the interactivity and intuitiveness of theoretical teaching, enhance the application-oriented function of practical teaching, improve the class participation and subjective initiative of students in all classes, and stimulate their spirit of inquiry to combine the knowledge of computer organization with the upper-level applications related to their majors."

It is presented as the solution to problems that we can now solve thanks to the new techniques and methodologies at our disposal. It is emerging as a key capacity for society and, especially, for the current job market. As such, it is a competency that must be incorporated into secondary education. This is because young people must have the necessary training to understand how data is acquired and used in the world, with the aim of achieving more complete professional profiles. The purpose of this work is to outline a Data Science framework as a transversal competence to be incorporated in Secondary Education. For this, a reflection is presented after conducting a review of previous works, focused on the professional sector, and supporting it with the findings of a representative survey of Spanish citizens. The results show that the level of understanding and interest of young people in Data Science is insufficient for the current context and, especially, the labor market."

Since it is a new field, only a handful of schools offer a data science program, most of those being large research institutions. This presents a unique opportunity for smaller schools to combine an exciting and highly relevant topic with the personalized education, small class sizes, and individual attention they are known for. On the flip side, building out data science at small schools also presents numerous challenges, including finding sufficient faculty time and expertise, attracting a sufficient number of students, forging interdepartmental connections, and convincing the administration to approve the new courses and program. In this poster, we present lessons learned from data science efforts at three small institutions, including one which recently successfully developed a data science certificate (containing four new data science courses)."

However, little work has been done on using blocks languages to teach adults, and even less work has looked at blocks languages for data science. We have integrated Blockly, a blocks-based programming environment, into JupyterLab, one of the leading computational notebook development environments for data science. Our integration, which is publicly released as a JupyterLab extension, allows users to assemble blocks-based programs in a GUI workspace and then render the blocks as textual code (e.g., Python) in a computational notebook cell. Additional features of the extension are notebook sync, which clears and restores the blocks workspace as the user navigates to different notebook cells, and intelliblocks, dynamically generated blocks that are created when users load software packages. In this demonstration, we show how learners can use blocks to solve data science problems in a JupyterLab computational notebook.

0ff5036dcefee772b4d6eb3910694ccd47d3ab6c,introducing data science topics to noncomputing majors,"Data science knowledge and skills have become indispensable to STEM and non-STEM disciplines alike. As a result, it has become crucial for students in non-computing majors to learn data science techniques, particularly in the context of their own disciplines. A majority of current university data science coursework, however, requires sufficient depth in programming and statistical skills related to managing, manipulating, and analyzing data, which reduces their usefulness for entry-level non-computing majors. This workshop presents a set of hands-on exercises to introduce data science to entry-level non-computing majors. The exercises cover the data science lifecycle, including data acquisition, preparation, model development and deployment, visualization, and storytelling. A freely-available web-based Data Science Learning Platform (DSLP) will be presented to show how to perform hands-on data science exercises with little or no coding background. The presenters will also share their experiences in using the DSLP tool in an entry-level data science course to non-computing majors at RIT. Both the tool and course materials will be shared with workshop participants. The typical workshop participant is a high school teacher or a college instructor interested in teaching data science at the introductory level. No prior programming or data science experience is needed, thus making the workshop materials usable by a wide audience. Participants need to have a laptop with access to the Internet to attend the hands-on exercises workshop. The laptop should have a current web browser (e.g., Safari or Chrome) installed to access the web-based learning platform. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Award 2021287."

As an inherently interdisciplinary area, data science both draws from and generates interest within many fields, including computer science."
e32221cddbdca3d72c1e5aa18ab2ee2b64f26bac,data science for the real estate industry,"World's major industries, such as Financial Services, Telecom, Advertising, Healthcare, Education, etc, have attracted the attention of the KDD community for decades. Hundreds of KDD papers have been published on topics related to these industries and dozens of workshops organized---some of which have become an integral part of the conference agenda (e.g. the Health Day). Somewhat unexpectedly, the KDD conference has barely addressed the real estate industry, despite its enormous size and prominence. The reason for that apparent mismatch is two-fold: (a) until recently, the real estate industry did not appreciate the value data science methods could add (with some exceptions, such as econometrics methods for creating real-estate price indices); (b) the Data Science community has not been aware of challenging real estate problems that are perfectly suited to its methods. This tutorial provides a step towards resolving this issue. We provide an introduction to real estate for data scientists, and outline a spectrum of data science problems, many of which are being tackled by new ""prop-tech"" companies, while some are yet to be approached. We present concrete examples from three of these companies (where the authors work): Airbnb -- the most popular short-term rental marketplace, Cherre -- a real estate data integration platform, and Compass -- the largest independent real estate brokerage in the U.S."
234c11816ee2a0de84b6549bed9cb4d443338c9e,a course on applied ai and data science recommender systems,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science have become one of the most popular curricula in the computing educations. Plenty of theories, optimizations and math are involved in these courses, which results in a higher degree of difficulty for students to learn, not to mention the students without specializations in computer science or information technology. Beyond the complicated knowledge and theories, students may prefer to learn and focus on applied AI or data science which refer to the knowledge or skills for practical problem-solving and real-world applications. For example, information retrieval has been listed as one of the curricula in several undergraduate and/or graduate programs in the AI or data science programs. This paper describes a course that focuses on the topic of recommender systems which is in high demand in both academia and industries. This course has been extremely successful at the authors' institutions. In this paper, we introduce the course's objectives, structure and methodologies, discuss possible ways to deliver hands-on practice, summarize the outcomes, and finally present the lessons learned, as well as the feedbacks from the students. These experience could be useful and may give advice to other educators looking to create a similar course in their program."

In partnership with a local high school and members of its step team, we explore quantitative analysis of both visual and acoustic data captured from student dance. We describe prototype visualizations and interactive applications for evaluating pose precision, tempo, and timbre. With educational goals in mind, we have constrained our design to using only interpretable features and simple, accessible algorithms."
4b165906ec9ff43905437a0fba6ee978464f2166,knime analytics platform for visual data science and business analytics teaching,"Business analytics and data science are gaining popularity in industry and academia. Driven by the continuing demand from industry, universities in the US and abroad have started graduate certificates and degree-awarding programs at undergraduate, graduate, and executive education levels. Because of its broad and multi-faceted coverage of hard and soft subjects and skills, the teaching of business analytics and data science has not been easy. One proven way to make the learning of the foundational concepts and best practices more intuitive for students is to utilize a visual, workflow-driven software platform. The goal is to reduce the syntactic nature of data science so that more time and mental capacity can be spent on concepts. KNIME Analytics Platform (a free and open-source software environment) is an excellent candidate for intuitive teaching, learning, and practicing platform with a complete set of functionalities for business analytics, data science, and machine learning. The current tutorial will demonstrate the ease of modeling with KNIME. The audience can follow along by installing KNIME on their laptop via knime.org."
4127b8363103692e0038bbd887056d57d9391cd8,interactive visualizations to introduce data science for high school students,"Artificial intelligence integrates with our daily life in more ways each day with the invention of new tools and applications. For example, businesses utilize machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, to identify the ideal customer for targeted advertisement. Machine learning and data science scale previous manual problems to a wider customer base. With all the various applications for artificial intelligence, there is still a noticeable gap in the number of qualified job applicants who can solve some of the machine learning problems of the day. There is a movement to introduce computer science education earlier to K-12 students. One motivation behind an earlier introduction is to better prepare students to study computer science at universities and fulfill these coveted technology positions in the future. Given this motivation, there needs to be more computer science instructional activities and lesson plans to support K-12 teachers. Currently there are several new tools and curricula available for computer science. However, there is a need for beginner and K-12 accessible data science and machine learning instructional methods. These topics are advanced computer science electives but an earlier introduction can still benefit students. Interactive visual activities support high school students to learn challenging topics. In this paper, we consider how a visual analytic process can present difficult data science concepts. We present an interactive visual educational tool to teach data science to high school students. The first activity introduces the visual analytic pipeline. The next interactive activities present machine learning classification and regression topics. We select datasets and applications which are relatable to our main audience. This paper describes the design and implementation of the data science educational tool for high school students."

The teaching methodology will include lectures and a heavy hands-on component."
587eeb7bdd95a6b28af0122ef5b177dac8031157,data science for social good and public policy examples opportunities and challenges,"Can data science help reduce police violence and misconduct? Can it help increase retention of patients in care? Can it help prevent children from getting lead poisoning? Can it help cities better target limited resources to improve lives of citizens? We're all aware of the hype around data science and related buzzwords right now but turning this hype into social impact takes cross-disciplinary training, teams, and methods. In this talk, I'll discuss lessons learned from our work at University of Chicago while working on dozens of data science projects over the past few years with non-profits and governments on high-impact public policy and social challenges in criminal justice, public health, education, economic development, public safety, workforce training, and urban infrastructure. I'll highlight opportunities for IR researchers to get involved in these efforts as well as information retrieval challenges that are open research problems that need to be solved in order to increase the effectiveness of today's machine learning and data science algorithms in order to have social and policy impact in a fair and equitable manner."
81e1e9375a939e1a4c6d0185d38bb6cbda394f96,scaling up data science course projects a case study,"Large-scale, online Data Science (DS) courses and degree programs are becoming increasingly common due to the global rise in popularity and demand for data scientists. Although project-based learning is integral to gaining hands-on experience in DS education, providing fair, timely, and high-quality feedback on varied projects for a large number of diverse students is challenging. To address those challenges in scaling up the assessment of DS group projects, we integrated multiple techniques, such as rapid feedback, peer grading, graders as meta-reviewers, etc. We present a case study of deploying those strategies for group projects in a large online DS course titled Text Information Systems offered in Fall, 2020. We synthesize our findings from analyzing student and grader survey responses, and share useful lessons and future work."
1af81823f9ba43b1718dbd3cdc815cf033030c05,introduction to data science as a pathway to further study in computing,"Several institutions have recently introduced Introduction to Data Science courses that involve a substantial programming component and do not require CS1 as a prerequisite. Programming and computational thinking are central to the emerging discipline of data science, and so there is overlap between traditional CS1 courses and Introduction to DS. Partly because of the evident societal significance of data science and because data science does not have the problematic reputation of computer science, Intro to DS can attract new and diverse audiences that may not have been interested in taking CS1. We explore Intro to DS as a possible alternative path into computing: what are the learning goals in Intro to DS that involve programming and/or computational thinking? How generalizable are the problems students solve in Intro to DS to what students would encounter in future studies? Is it feasible for students to pursue a data science sequence rather than CS1-CS2 and be prepared for a career that uses data science? To what extent can a pathway through a data science sequence diversify the population of students who graduate from degree programs in computer science and data science? We survey the Introduction to Data Science courses offered in North American post-secondary education, and focus on a data science sequence that uses the R programming language and does not require CS1 at an R1 institution as a case study."
cf0184d556cf1ea248cf84f3990ecfd3f4648e99,mutually beneficial collaborations to broaden participation of hispanics in data science,"Representation of Hispanics, especially Hispanic women, is notoriously low in data science programs in higher education and in the tech industry. The engagement of undergraduate students in research, often and early in their path towards degree completion, has been championed as one of the principal reforms necessary to increase the number of capable professionals in STEM. The benefits attributed to undergraduate research experiences have been reported to disproportionately benefit individuals from groups that have been historically underrepresented in STEM. The IDI-BD2K (Increasing Diversity in Interdisciplinary Big Data to Knowledge) Program funded by the NIH at the University of Puerto Rico Río Piedras (UPRRP) was designed to bridge the increasing digital and data divide at the university. The college's population is 98 percent Hispanic and yet there is no formal data science program. There also exists a gender imbalance in computing at the College of Natural Sciences at the UPRRP. Over 60 percent of the undergraduate students in Biology are women. However, the percentage of women in Computer Science hovers around 15 percent. The IDI-BD2K was created to address both these concerns and increase the participation of Hispanics in interdisciplinary computational and quantitative research. In this talk, I will highlight the need for mutually beneficial university collaborations to reduce the digital and data divide, create greater awareness of the growing disparities and increase the number of future faculty with experience teaching diverse students."
a8515f3ae3997313cc2796d0446b61cda1ccb93c,easing learners into data science via visualization of concepts and computations,"In my research, I will explore the potential of adapting the literature on algorithm visualization and visual analogy to the teaching of concepts and computations in introductory data science. Using computerized tutorials informed by the extensive literature on multimedia principles already available, I will explore if a visual pseudo-code facilitates simulation and application of data algorithms, beyond the facilitation afforded by mathematical notation. The research will combine between-subject classroom interventions with distance learning and within-subject laboratory studies. The dissertation will give fine-grained evidence on which types are more effective and how it could be implemented in the community at large. I am primarily interested in discussing methodological issues relating to how to make comparisons in such a multi-dimensional design space."
2a199d0995ae9b9f6aa5753d3f54c77c843327ee,exploring metrics for the analysis of code submissions in an introductory data science course,"While data science education has gained increased recognition in both academic institutions and industry, there has been a lack of research on automated coding assessment for novice students. Our work presents a first step in this direction, by leveraging the coding metrics from traditional software engineering (Halstead Volume and Cyclomatic Complexity) in combination with those that reflect a data science project’s learning objectives (number of library calls and number of common library calls with the solution code). Through these metrics, we examined the code submissions of 97 students across two semesters of an introductory data science course. Our results indicated that the metrics can identify cases where students had overly complicated codes and would benefit from scaffolding feedback. The number of library calls, in particular, was also a significant predictor of changes in submission score and submission runtime, which highlights the distinctive nature of data science programming. We conclude with suggestions for extending our analyses towards more actionable intervention strategies, for example by tracking the fine-grained submission grading outputs throughout a student’s submission history, to better model and support them in their data science learning process."
abfdb88b1b665c5cbea0b94b42a2f91fa15002a8,brainstorming data science as a fluency course for nonmajors and as a new specialization abstract only,"Data Science programs are emerging in many areas and are related to many disciplines. This includes sciences, social sciences, business, journalism, history, and any other area dealing with massive amounts of data. Some institutions are establishing majors or minors in data science while others need to incorporate some level of introduction to relevant topics within the context of other coursework. The BOF will engage SIGCSE participants who have views on the content and role of courses and programs in data science. Two existing NSF sponsored projects will seed the discussion. One of the projects investigates the use of flipped classroom instruction for course material in data science, with significant attention to what can be done with a minimum of prerequisites. The other project produced a workshop to elicit opinions from a number of perspectives on what are the core elements of data science and how the subject is seen by different disciplines. Results from the workshop will be available at SIGCSE. With these as a starting point, participants in the Birds of a Feather session will explore the emerging field of data science and its relationship to computer science education."
02ef5b9824ac3890e36f84b808b67ff0d8fd8c6f,design and assessment of a taskdriven introductory data science course taught concurrently in multiple languages python r and matlab,"We discuss the design, effectiveness, and curricular impacts of an introductory data science course that uniquely meets a number of competing constraints. Student needs range from an initial exploration for future data scientists to the only computing course for some science students. Initially, associated research labs, departments, and industries provided differing perspectives on skills and preferred programming languages. The focus was on practical programming skills and learning through demos to develop useful skills quickly. The task-driven nature also enabled the mutual development of resources for each of the top three requested languages, Python, R, and MATLAB, allowing students to concurrently complete the course in any of the three languages. Tutorials in all three languages were produced to prepare students for the language-independent task-driven assignments given each day. For consistency all tutorials and assignments use the Jupyter notebook cell-based workflow. Feedback and performance measures of three student cohorts (Spring 2018, Fall 2018, and Spring 2019) are analyzed. Feedback included an average rating that met or exceeded 4 (""substantial progress"") out of 5 for each separate cohort on all four general educational objectives (Basic Understanding, Developing Skills, Application, and Numeric Methods). 75% of responding students indicated a preference for the multi-language course design. The course also attracted a majority of women every semester (63% female, average). Because of these benefits, this course became the recommended first programming course for a newly developed and approved undergraduate data science major.

In this study, the students used self-learning methods for interactive class. The class was managed through the online streaming system by the video conference applications. The study showed that the students’ coding and real- life problem solving skills were improved from hand-on experience. The LISC system model stimulated students’ learning levels. This was proved by applying the proposed method to the Data Science class at Silpakorn University, Thailand, joined by an instructor from Japan. When the course ended, the evaluation from the participating students showed that they were much satisfied that their skills were up-leveled for coding and real-life problem solving, and their attitudes towards the Data Science class improved. It implied and confirmed that the proposed method was efficient to the students’ practical learning level, among the new normal living period in the Coronavirus pandemic."
47dd8c831c8a3ae29dae16ac96ab480812fa38ac,the challenges of evolving technical courses at scale four case studies of updating large data science courses,"Instructors who teach large-scale technical courses, especially on data science and programming, must do a large amount of logistical work when updating their courses. All of this behind-the-scenes labor takes time away from the pedagogically-meaningful work of teaching students. Over the past five years, the authors of this paper have created and updated eight courses for an undergraduate data science program that serves over 2,000 students per year. We present four case studies from our teaching experiences that highlight major challenges in maintaining and updating technical courses: 1) There were intricate dependencies between course materials, so making updates to one part of the course would require updating many other parts. 2) We needed to maintain several variants of course materials such as assignments. 3) We wrote large amounts of ad-hoc custom software infrastructure to manage logistics. 4) We could not easily reuse software written by others. Our case studies point to design ideas for instructor-oriented tools that can reduce the logistical complexities of teaching at scale, thus letting instructors focus on the substance of teaching rather than on mundane logistics."

The goal of the panel is to present the findings, but also to obtain perspectives from the attendees in order to enrich the task force's work."
857b0f1d973151162c7cd52b876a1a271a12361e,ai education matters a first introduction to modeling and learning using the data science workflow,"Traditionally artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses are taught at the senior and graduate level in higher-education computer science curricula following the mastery learning strategy, cf. Figure 1. This makes sense, since most AI and ML models and the theory behind them require a substantial understanding of probability and statistics, as well as advanced calculus and matrix algebra. To understand Logistic Regression as a probabilistic classifier performing maximum-likelihood or maximum-a-posteriori estimation, for example, students need to understand joint and conditional probability distributions. In order to derive the back propagation algorithm to train Neural Networks students need to understand partial derivatives and inner and outer tensor products. These are just two of many examples where substantial mathematical background - typically taught at the junior level in a computer science major program - is required. With AI and ML algorithms being used more widely by enterprises across domains, as well as, in applications and services we use in our daily lives, it makes sense to raise awareness about what AI is, what it can and cannot do, and how it is used to solve problems to a broader audience. Very much in the same spirit as the ""CS for all"" idea (https://www.csforall.org), we have to extend our curricula to include introductory courses to AI and ML on the early undergraduate level (or even in high-school) to expose students to the ideas and working principles of AI technology. One way to achieve this is to introduce the principles of working with data, modeling, and learning through the data science workflow."
4efe658b562731d91f7ea5304ef5f5496ba233e4,metadata a tool to supplement data science education for the first year undergraduates,"In the Indian Universities, data science courses are offered to computer science undergraduates only in their higher semesters of under-graduation. Keeping in mind, the growing importance of data science, under-graduates need to be introduced to data science courses in their first year of under-graduation itself. Although first year undergraduates are furnished with the required mathematical and statistical concepts during their higher secondary education, a requirement of understanding sophisticated programming concepts hamstrings universities from offering courses in data science to first year undergraduates. As an outcome of our research, we propose a software named MetaData. MetaData abstracts all levels of implementation and helps students better understand the fundamental concepts in data science by observing the applicability of these concepts on real-world datasets. We justify the effectiveness of the tool through a data science classroom scenario, wherein 44 first year undergraduates were encouraged to use the tool and provide constructive feedback."

The rise of Data Science as a discipline has also led to the creation of new courses whose content significantly overlaps that of an introductory database course. This column presents a series of perspectives on data (base/science) education to help educators think about what we should be teaching in our courses, and what resources we should use to teach them. This episode contains two contributions. The first discusses a recent effort called OpenDS4All, whose goal is to accelerate the creation of Data Science curricula by providing a “starter set” of open source data science training materials, including PowerPoint slides and Jupyter Notebooks with Python code. The second presents a process for making pedagogical decisions of how to construct a data management class given the wealth of content that can be included."

Uber, Facebook, 23andMe, Tesla -- they aren't just technology companies; they are data companies. And yet the reality is that these companies are still anomalies. Large, successful companies usually still treat KDD as either an afterthought or as an experiment. It's not core to how they run the business. As practitioners we compound this problem by concentrating our efforts on valuable business problems; but ones which are usually on the periphery of the business. We do this because changing the heart of how a company operates requires more than just process or technology changes. It requires cultural changes. And these cultural changes usually trigger corporate antibodies adverse to anything new. This talk will review some practical realities of instituting data-driven decisions in a very large multi-national company."

Its mission is to provide a focal point for the College's capabilities in multidisciplinary data-driven research by coordinating advanced data science research for college scientists and partners, and educating the next generation of data scientists. We surveyed the data-driven research needs at Imperial College London to gain an understanding across all disciplines offered by the College, and analysed the responses to gain insights into scientific and engineering needs for data science research.
 A clear message is that multidisciplinarity is essential for Big Data and data science research to enable a ""chemistry of sciences"": connecting all disciplines by integrating data. This paper presents our efforts to best understand data-driven research needs in a highly multidisciplinary research-intensive institution and describes our vision for the future of the Data Science Institute at Imperial College London."

6bb9c140cbf93b7ccbb5cdc5802862c2e40132e8,bdk erudite the educational resource discovery index for data science,"The field of data science has developed over the years to enable the efficient integration and analysis of the increasingly large amounts of data being generated across many domains, ranging from social media, to sensor networks, to scientific experiments. Numerous subfields of biology and medicine, such as genetics, neuroimaging, and mobile health, are witnessing a data explosion that promises to revolutionize biomedical science by yielding novel insights and discoveries. To address the challenges posed by biomedical big data, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative (datascience.nih.gov). An important component of this effort is the training of biomedical researchers. To this end, the NIH has funded the BD2K Training Coordinating Center (TCC). A core activity of the BD2K TCC is to develop a web portal (bigdatau.org) to provide personalized training in data science to biomedical researchers. In this paper, we describe our approach and initial efforts in constructing ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index for Data Science, which powers the BD2K TCC web portal. ERuDIte harvests a wealth of resources available online for learning data science, both for beginners and experts, including massive open online courses (MOOCs), videos of tutorials and research talks presented at conferences, textbooks, blog posts, and standalone web pages. Though the potential volume of resources is exciting, these online learning materials are highly heterogeneous in quality, difficulty, format, and topic. As a result, this mix of content makes the field intimidating to enter and difficult to navigate. Moreover, data science is a rapidly evolving field, so there is a constant influx of new materials and concepts. ERuDIte leverages data science techniques to build the data science index. This paper describes how ERuDIte uses data extraction, data integration, machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing techniques to automatically collect, integrate, describe and organize existing online resources for learning data science."

Although data science research is developing at a high pace, the educational process in the field has been left behind in terms of educational tools and practices, despite the high number of data science courses offered and the number of involved stakeholders (professors, tutors, and students). The present work aims to cover the gap of educational data science tools by proposing a novel platform; the platform, coined Data Science Tutor (DaST), is a free online tool that offers automated step-by-step exercise solving in a variety of data science algorithms/techniques aiming at giving insight to the particularities of each algorithm. The solutions of the exercises are accompanied with in-context explanations that refer to the operation of the respective algorithm/technique, and are compatible with the terminology and the methodology in popular textbooks. The tool aims at students, lecturers, and data practitioners in many diverse fields (ranging from data analysts to transport engineers to logistics managers) that want to learn the particularities of data science algorithms in a stepwise, interactive manner. Through the proposed platform (a) students in the data science field or in related courses (e.g., machine learning, information retrieval) may get solutions for different types of exercises and focus on the details of each algorithm, (b) tutors (lecturers, lab assistants) may easily produce a wide variety of exercises with the accompanying solutions and use them in classroom or as an auxiliary tool for test correction, and (c) data practitioners may get valuable insights on popular data science algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed platform is the first educational tool that aims at the data science field, and has so far been warmly accepted by departments worldwide."

Current HPC platforms can achieve calculations on the order of quadrillions of calculations per second with quintillions on the horizon. The past three decades witnessed a vast increase in the use of HPC across different scientific, engineering and business communities, for example, sequencing the genome, predicting climate changes, designing modern aerodynamics, or establishing customer preferences. Although HPC has been well incorporated into science curricula such as bioinformatics, the same cannot be said for most computing programs. This working group will explore how HPC can make inroads into computer science education, from the undergraduate to postgraduate levels. The group will address research questions designed to investigate topics such as identifying and handling barriers that inhibit the adoption of HPC in educational environments, how to incorporate HPC into various curricula, and how HPC can be leveraged to enhance applied critical thinking and problem solving skills. Four deliverables include: (1) a catalog of core HPC educational concepts, (2) HPC curricula for contemporary computing needs, such as in artificial intelligence, cyberanalytics, data science and engineering, or internet of things, (3) possible infrastructures for implementing HPC coursework, and (4) HPC-related feedback to the CC2020 project."

Computing educators are only now beginning to recognize the need for HPC Education (HPCEd). Building on earlier work, this working group explored how HPCEd can make inroads into computing education, focusing on the undergraduate level. This paper presents the background of HPC and HPCEd, identifies several of the needed core HPC competencies for students, identifies the support needed by educators for HPCEd, and explores the symbiosis between HPCEd and computing education in contemporary areas such as artificial intelligence and data science, as well as how HPCEd can be applied to benefit diverse non-computing domains such as atmospheric science, biological sciences and critical infrastructure protection. Finally, the report makes several recommendations to improve and facilitate HPC education in the future."
aa52a469ba09902ec894a72ae7341cc1551c4edc,enhancing data education with datathons an experience with open data on renewable energy systems,"Data literacy and the fundamentals of big data management are becoming interdisciplinary in Higher Education curricula, also due to the widespread need of data science skills. This casts the need for presenting novel (and more engaging) learning activities to students. Data hackathons (also known as datathons) represent a viable option to allow students practicing with real use cases and datasets, as well as addressing their learning experiences collaboratively. Moreover, datathons promise to improve soft skills and offer hands-on learning opportunities. Therefore, we present in this paper a datathon on a publicly available dataset about renewable energy systems. The datathon involved students from three data-focused courses of three different M.S. degrees at the University of Salento (Italy). A detailed analysis of the design, implementation and evaluation choices is proposed, along with a series of gathered insights and lessons learned that might help systematizing the introduction and use of datathons in data education."

Data scientists are expected to have a wide range of technical skills alongside being passionate self-directed people who are able to work easily with others and deliver high quality outputs under pressure. There are hundreds of university, commercial, and online courses in data science and related topics. Apart from people with breadth and depth of knowledge and experience in data science, we identify a new educational path to train ""bridge persons"" who combine knowledge of an organization's business with sufficient knowledge and understanding of data science to ""bridge"" between non-technical people in the business with highly skilled data scientists who add value to the business. The increasing proliferation of big data and the great advances made in data science do not herald in an era where all problems can be solved by deep learning and artificial intelligence. Although data science opens up many commercial and social opportunities, data science must complement other science in the search for new theory and methods to understand and manage our complex world."

These processes enable educators to work up realistic and tangible aspects of computing science using everyday examples. Programming, networks, communication protocols, web design and development, electrical engineering, data science, CAD and even project management can be combined with smart home in terms of content. For this reason, we have used open source tools to develop a cost-effective infrastructure that combines the above-mentioned aspects in a single kit. This kit is based on various in-house developed sensors and actuators based on the ESP8266, a Raspberry Pi as the central unit and Node-RED as the framework for linking the hardware. This hardware can be connected without writing code or previous knowledge, enables a quick experience of success while offering much potential for internal differentiation in teaching."

This requires of instructors to develop resources that get students up and running quickly. This study presents and evaluates a learning design that (1) uses a pattern-oriented tutorial to teach language-independent key operations for implementing data analytic queries, and (2) uses cheat sheets to show how these operations map onto language-specific syntax. The evaluation study (N=21) concludes that using this approach, two thirds of the data science novices sampled could implement simple to moderately complex queries in all the aforementioned languages within two hours. A permutation test moreover produced a significant main effect of language, with SQL ranking the highest in accuracy. The results form part of a general discussion on the merits and language-dependent feasibility of pattern-oriented aids for accelerated data science instruction."

In the past 20 years, amateur fanfiction writers, often young people between the ages of 13 and 25, have published over 61.5 billion words of fiction in online repositories, an amount that rivals the Google Books English fiction corpus of 80 billion words covering the past five centuries. Far from mere shallow repositories of pop culture, these sites are accumulating significant evidence that sophisticated informal learning is taking place online in novel and unexpected ways. Dr. Katie Davis will discuss insights from her book, Writers in the Secret Garden: Fanfiction, Youth, and New Forms of Mentoring (Aragon & Davis, 2019). Davis will describe how young people are utilizing new forms of technology to mentor each other in writing fanfiction, and developing their writing skills in the process. Over the course of five years, Davis and her co-author Dr. Cecilia Aragon conducted original mixed-methods research of online fanfiction repositories, combining their respective skills in data science and education. During the course of their research, they discovered a new kind of mentoring, which they call distributed mentoring, that is uniquely suited to networked communities, where people of all ages and experience levels engage with and support one another through a complex, interwoven tapestry of interactive, cumulatively sophisticated advice and informal instruction. Davis will use the insights from this research to reflect on what it is, exactly, about networked publics that can so effectively support interest-driven learning, and she will consider whether it's possible to apply these lessons to formal education environments."

From the perspective of data science, this paper takes the group of academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering as an example to explore the method of cultivating high-end talents. Through multidimensional data analysis, it is of great significance to explore the spatial pattern and time evolution characteristics of the first generation of top natural science talents in China, to deepen the understanding of the growth and education laws of talents, optimize top-level design, and implement targeted scientific policies. It is found that Chinese culture and Chinese native universities have made significant contributions for the early scientific talents of China, and the analysis method of data science can be used to facilitate the education innovation."

To define the initial criteria, we developed a list of critical questions that the framework must address, including what moderators are most important to include, how to address homogeneity across various studies, how to define categories of influencing factors, and how to compute summary effect size. This initial framework describes how the meta-analysis is derived from effect sizes that are calculated based on each mean and standard deviation reported in experimental and quasi-experimental studies. Since the goal of this foundational research is to create an auto-generated meta-analysis tool, we define a basic user experience that would allow users to select moderators and predefined levels of heterogeneity (such as ""include only random control group studies"" or ""include studies reported in journal articles"") for inclusion in the meta-analysis. We conducted a feasibility study of the framework using data (number of participants, mean, standard deviation) collected from 21 data samples curated from eight computer science education articles with a primary and secondary focus across ten venues (2012-2018). We consider what we learned conducting the study, including the need for full system transparency, issues related to data integrity, and issues related to defining and selecting appropriate formulas for differing sets of data."

Approaches more focused on majors include adaptations to a traditional introduction to data structures course that may heavily incorporate object-oriented programming or emphasize using data structures from libraries. Paths that might be concurrent with a traditional CS2, or have greater appeal to non-majors include recent efforts with data science or secure computing. In a world of increasingly limited resources but ever-increasing needs and demands from inside and outside the major, how do we provide solutions? Bringing together educators who are concerned about intermediate CS education will allow participants to hear multiple viewpoints about what the needs are and how various institutions are currently, or are considering, addressing them. The discussion leaders will kick off the conversation with local expertise---one approach of a CS2 course for majors and non-majors that emphasizes data science and modern practical skills such as databases and HTTP, another with new curricula for multiple CS2 courses, and a third with novel approaches in a traditional data structures CS2 course. Attendees will be able to connect with other people interested in the future of course curricula following CS1 and share ideas, resources, successes, and failures. We will be soliciting participants' perspectives on preparing CS2 students for downstream paths, including (i) future courses, (ii) interviews, (iii) internships, and (iv) research projects."

Consequently, the field of data science has emerged as one of the key areas in industry among engineers, scientists, and IT professionals alike. In this paper, we derive a Data Analytics Body of Knowledge (DA-BoK) from the existing Data Science BoK (DS-BoK) as a means to provide data analytics content throughout the curriculum of an institution's undergraduate IT degree programs. A series of four Knowledge Areas are subdivided into Knowledge Units that can be introduced into existing IT courses through four embedding types, including lectures by example, labs, case studies, and projects. A case study is presented using our three IT programs as examples of how this content can be introduced at three levels of Bloom's Taxonomy (i.e. vocabulary, comprehension, application) through each of the embedding types. Finally, insights and guidance are provided on how to improve the proposed data analytics embedded IT curriculum in order to meet the demands of the modern data analytics pipeline in industry."

More recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of NoSQL database systems, especially in data science. Bringing NoSQL databases to the classroom is important not only to prepare our students for the technology that they will face, but also because the underlying paradigm introduces new ideas that are not typically emphasized in a relational-only database course alone. However, NoSQL systems seem to receive dramatically less coverage in undergraduate database curricula than relational systems do. This panel discusses examples of how NoSQL can be introduced into undergraduate education, and the possible challenges faced in doing so. Questions from the audience will be invited."

While students explicitly interested in the topic may choose to take courses designed only to teach ethical thinking in computer science, we have a societal need to ""teach ethics"" in a wider variety of computing courses. With the powerful tools that we give students comes responsibility, and students should know how to consider ethical implications of the things they build. The difficulty of developing strategies to ""teach ethics"" in computing courses is that 1) teaching computing ethics is different than teaching other computational courses, requiring more than the simple transmission of information or knowledge 2) we lack a way to assess the efficacy of the strategies we use to accomplish the ""more."" We aim to foster a discussion on the current research and instructional approaches, led by researchers who are actively teaching responsible computer science and data science in a variety of institutional settings (e.g., private, public, small, large, etc.). In addition to forming new research and teaching collaborations, we hope this discussion will inspire the larger community of computer science educators to embed computing ethics and social impact in their technical courses."
bea9d36c1c7cbb94d62c6b895d6b8b3c7a1041dc,towards a more representative politics in the ethics of computer science,"Ethics curricula in computer science departments should include a focus on the political action of students. While 'ethics' holds significant sway over current discourse in computer science, recent work, particularly in data science, has shown that this discourse elides the underlying political nature of the problems that it aims to solve. In order to avoid these pitfalls---such as co-option, whitewashing, and assumed universal values---we should recognize and teach the political nature of computing technologies, largely through science and technology studies. Education is an essential focus not just intrinsically, but also because computing students end up joining the companies which have outsize impacts on our lives. At those companies, students both have a responsibility to society and agency beyond just engineering decisions, albeit not uniformly. I propose that we move away from strict ethics curricula and include examples of and calls for political action of students and future engineers. Through such examples---calls to action, practitioner reflections, legislative engagement, direct action---we might allow engineers to better recognize both their diverse agencies and responsibilities."
aff2e7ad2ddfbf6b89788ac7cf1e8e1b5386d87f,data for good abstract,"I use the tagline ""Data for Good"" to state paronomastically how we as a community should be promoting data science, especially in training future generations of data scientists. First, we should use data science for the good of humanity and society. Data science should be used to better people's lives. Data science should be used to improve relationships among people, organizations, and institutions. Data science, in collaboration with other disciplines, should be used to help tackle societal grand challenges such as climate change, education, energy, environment, healthcare, inequality, and social justice. Second, we should use data in a good manner. The acronym FATES suggests what ""good"" means. Fairness means that the models we build are used to make unbiased decisions or predictions. Accountability means to determine and assign responsibility-to someone or to something-for a judgment made by a machine. Transparency means being open and clear to the end user about how an outcome, e.g., a classification, a decision, or a prediction, is made. Ethics for data science means paying attention to both the ethical and privacy-preserving collection and use of data as well as the ethical decisions that the automated systems we build will make. Safety and security (yes, two words for one ""S"") means ensuring that the systems we build are safe (do no harm) and secure (guard against malicious behavior)."

Academic institutions, industry, and other sectors in the life sciences are creating jobs that involve computation, data science, and data visualization. Therefore, there is a need for life scientists to understand and be trained in computation for this new job market. Many life science students are not taught foundational concepts of computation as a part of their curriculum. Therefore, there exists a gap in understanding when beginning to learn computer science (CS) and relate it to data-centric questions in other fields. To improve learning experiences and help train these students, this work sought to understand existing challenges that life science students face in learning scientific programming and identify routes for improvement. To do so, we evaluated three distinct learning experiences--- a hands-on workshop, structured coursework, and long-term research experiences. Based on these student evaluations, we highlight the major challenges and benefits of different learning environments and provide suggestions to educators and institutions for integrating scientific programming education in life science coursework or research. Student-centered, group environments were the most successful at engaging students in computing concepts. Overall, this work provides strategies to enrich learning experiences and promote best practices in computation for life science students and engage these students in the development of in-demand skills."

The general question of what mathematics should be required of computer science majors naturally leads to more specific questions such as: What mathematics content should be required? What mathematical concepts? Should the theory of computation be required? Should calculus, discrete mathematics, probability, and/or linear algebra? What impact do newer fields such as data science and machine learning have on the mathematics needed or required for computer science majors? What are faculty members doing to integrate mathematics into their computer science courses and does this help some students overcome difficulties learning the mathematics? What level of mathematical maturity should a computer science graduate attain? In this session, participants will share their answers to these questions with the goal of coming to a broader understanding of how mathematics informs the discipline. Through this discussion, we will try to reconcile our idealized curriculum with the practical reality of requirements, dependencies, and limits imposed by our institutions."

What does the end-to-end workflow of a data scientist's collaboration with clients look like throughout the lifetime of a project? To investigate this question, we interviewed ten data scientists (5 female, 4 male, 1 non-binary) in diverse roles across industry and academia. We discovered that they work with clients in a six-stage outer-loop workflow, which involves 1) laying groundwork by building trust before a project begins, 2) orienting to the constraints of the client's environment, 3) collaboratively framing the problem, 4) bridging the gap between data science and domain expertise, 5) the inner loop of technical data analysis work, 6) counseling to help clients emotionally cope with analysis results. This novel outer-loop workflow contributes to CSCW by expanding the notion of what collaboration means in data science beyond the widely-known inner-loop technical workflow stages of acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, modeling, and visualizing data. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science education, parallels to design work, and unmet needs for tool development."
c629bc75e0a1b4b47aae2480010ea81a35338cf7,how students in computingrelated majors distinguish social implications of technology,"The demand for machine learning and data science has grown exponentially in recent years. Yet, as the influence of these fields reach farther into daily life, the disparate impacts of these algorithms and models on more marginalized populations have also begun to surface rapidly. To address this emerging crisis, it is necessary to equip the next generation of computer scientists with the ethical tools needed to tackle these issues. Thus, an exploratory study was conducted to investigate how students who are currently enrolled in computing-related programs evaluate and understand the ethical and social impact of technology. 43 students in computing majors were presented with 5 scenarios of different technologies that utilizes machine learning to address potentially sensitive areas (e.g. policing, medical diagnosing). The long-format responses to these scenarios were qualitatively analyzed. Additionally, quantitative analysis was conducted after qualitatively coding the long-format responses into four sentiments. Ultimately, we found that participants were able to decipher the social implications of technology. However, many issues of systemic discrimination were missing from participants' analysis. Alarmingly, our findings also indicated that 50% or more of participants were not exposed to most of the technologies highlighted in the scenarios, which highlights a potential gap in computing curriculum of connecting ethics as well as racial, cultural, and socioeconomic understanding to computer science. Based on these results, we suggest that computing-related curriculum be reevaluated with ethical training in mind."

Previous studies have considered diet planning a combinatorial optimization problem to generate solutions that satisfy a diet's nutritional requirements. However, this approach does not consider the composition of diets, which is critical for diet recipients' to accept and enjoy menus with high nutritional quality. Without this consideration, feasible solutions for diet planning could not be provided in practice. This suggests the necessity of diet planning with machine learning, which extracts implicit composition patterns from real diet data and applies these patterns when generating diets. This work is original research that defines diet planning as a machine learning problem; we describe diets as sequence data and solve a controllable sequence generation problem. Specifically, we develop the Teacher-forced REINFORCE algorithm to connect neural machine translation and reinforcement learning for composition compliance with nutrition enhancement in diet generation. Through a real-world application to diet planning for children, we validated the superiority of our work over the traditional combinatorial optimization and modern machine learning approaches, as well as human (i.e., professional dietitians) performance. In addition, we construct and open the databases of menus and diets to motivate and promote further research and development of diet planning with machine learning. We believe this work with data science will contribute to solving economic and social problems associated with diet planning."

To address this challenge, we propose SQL2X, a novel SQL-centric learning model that teaches students SQL, NoSQL, and MapReduce via translation. For example, translating SQL queries into MapReduce programs to gain insights on how aggregation and join are performed in parallel in MapReduce, and translating SQL queries into REST requests to Firebase to help understand the differences between the query capability of SQL and NoSQL databases. We have applied the model to a graduate database course in our applied data science program. The evaluation and feedback from the students with diverse background indicate the effectiveness of the model in developing students' modeling, querying, and analytical skills over diverse data systems."

Higher-order functions are a standard and increasingly central component in many kinds of modern programming, including data science and Web development. Yet little research has been devoted to student learning or understanding of this topic. Objectives. We conducted formative research on how well students are able to correlate higher-order functions with their input–output behavior. We also wanted to evaluate a variety of techniques for assessing their understanding. Method. We created a series of instruments in which students were given either concrete input/output examples or abstracted diagrams of list transformations. Students were asked to cluster or classify these examples by their behavior, sometimes against a concrete list of higher-order functions and sometimes free-form. We administered these over the course of a month, and then once again three months later. Results. We find that students initially have several difficulties with clustering higher-order function examples. With different instruments, we find that students are later able to do quite well, largely avoiding large-scale errors but making several small-scale ones. We also find some evidence of growth in their thinking about these operations. We also find weaknesses in the nature and order of techniques we used. Discussion. Higher-order functions deserve far more attention than they have been paid in the literature on programming education. Their increasing use in several important domains makes this need critical. Our proposed methods for conducting such research are another contribution of this work. Our findings and methods should also be relevant for exploring how students understand libraries and APIs."

Within STEM, the computing and tech industry, specifically some niches, are expected to grow job opportunities more quickly than others. Emerging Technology (EmTech) concentrations like cybersecurity, data science, mobile development, machine learning, and cloud computing will have thousands of jobs in the next decade which will require a large pool of technical professionals. EmTech can use the largest untapped talent pool of women and returning women to fill the gap in the workforce. Hence, to understand the barriers and challenges faced by returning women to (re-) enter computing and tech fields, a three-day virtual conference, NSF RESET, was organized in March 2021. In this poster, we present the preliminary results on conference attendees' satisfaction level and effectiveness in facilitating resources to (re-)enter EmTech educational and professional pipeline."

Clearly such an interdisciplinary area crosses traditional boundaries ranging from statistics traditionally taught in mathematics or engineering departments, a new method of scientific discovery for biologists and chemists, a new challenge for ethicists and political scientists, and a new realm for design and electronic arts, etc. Within computer science departments, it currently seems to reside in the machine learning and knowledge discovery areas where the metaphor of big data as ""the new oil"" to be mined is pursued. In this talk, however, I opine that just as oil is important for the energy it generates, which powers the technologies of modern life, data is increasingly important for the information it generates, which will power the information applications of the future. We will explore some of these emerging trends, ranging from high performance modeling to the Watson AI system, looking at what we might want to be teaching our students if they are to be leaders in this emerging area."

Students assess the algorithmic fairness of a real-world criminal risk assessment tool (RAT), and reproduce results from an impactful story in ProPublica and a 2018 Science Advances paper. Students explore different measures of algorithmic fairness, and adjust the model they build to satisfy the false positive parity measure. Our target audience is students in Introduction to Data Science courses that do not require previous computing experience, as well as students in standard CS1 courses. We advocate for teaching predictive modelling in CS1. To facilitate the teaching of predictive modelling in CS1, we provide tutorials on predictive modelling and algorithmic fairness, in both Python and Java; we also provide a simplified ""Learning Machine"" API in those languages. Our approach enables teaching algorithmic fairness and predictive modelling more generally very early in the students' computing career.

330268ddd2f7df0d9a022f1969d3ce6d92efdb4a,plan composition using higherorder functions,"Background and Context. Program planning has been a long-standing and important problem in computing education. Finding useful primitives for planning and assessing whether students are able to understand and use these primitives remain open problems. We make progress on this problem by using higher-order functions (hofs) as planning operations. Not only are hofs increasingly prevalent in computing broadly, some data science programming sources also recommend their use in planning solutions to data-processing pipelines, giving our task additional applicability. Objectives. We first wish to confirm that students can understand the behavior of individual hofs. We also seek to understand which behavioral features of these hofs are reflected in their understanding. We then investigate their ability to plan solutions as the composition of hofs. We examine this from two perspectives: recognizing compositions from examples, and describing compositions to solve problems. Method. Our work is situated in early-stage tertiary education. To investigate student understanding of individual hofs, we present them with both input-output examples and open-ended questions. To investigate the composition of hofs, we use two formats. First, we use the same input-output format as for individual hofs. We then ask students to construct concrete plans for programming problems defined using text. These plans were constructed using a tool that was custom-built for this work. Students were then asked to write programs to solve the same problems. We perform both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the responses. Findings. We find students are proficient at recognizing individual hofs through input-output examples. They use a variety of features to identify hofs, with the most prominent features being type-based. While they do have difficulty recognizing compositions of hofs presented in the same input-output example format, there may be simple explanations for this. Either way, students are able to produce correct plans that require composing hofs, and can successfully translate these plans into correct code. Implications. We believe work in this vein has many useful consequences for programming education. Explicit planning atop a vocabulary of primitive operations has not received much attention in computing; our work suggests that hofs provide a useful initial set of planning primitives. (These are, however, generic and not problem-specific, so there is much room for growth.) However, students’ possible difficulties in recognizing hof compositions from examples warrants further attention."

With the immense amount of data now available from these environments, researchers need tools to process, manage, and analyze the data. Current methods used by many education researchers are inefficient; however, without data science experience tools used in other professions are not accessible. In this paper, we share about a tool we created called the Functional Understanding Navigator! (FUN! Tool). We have used this tool for different research projects which has allowed us the opportunity to (1) organize our workflow process from start to finish, (2) record log data of all of our analyses, and (3) provide a platform to share our analyses with others through GitHub.

Many Universities use online code editors for their large Computer Science (CS) courses. For example, the CS200 course at UC Berkeley uses Jupyter Notebooks to teach Python for data science to 800+ students. All the students in the course must write and submit their code assignments in the web-browser. These online code editors for large CS courses presents several benefits. One benefit is that it becomes easier to monitor the steps that a student takes to solve a coding problem since keystrokes can be tracked using Javascript. Another benefit is that the code written by students can be stored in one central database, creating less barriers for code analysis. The CodeKey project aims to take advantage of analyzing code patterns of students in a CS course in order to find key insights. CodeKey aims to find these insights by monitoring the interactions (i.e. clicks and keystrokes) of students as each student attempts to solve a coding problem. The goal is to study the code patterns of students in a CS course in order to understand similarities and differences between students who perform well on a problem and students who do not. We also aim to study how revealing these coding patterns to a student can increase his understanding of how to solve a difficult coding problem by showing common mistakes, and by showing simple steps that lead to the correct solution."

These discrepancies are generally resulted from the complexity of the system, the vagueness of the user requirements, or the lack of knowledge and experience of the software engineer. The principles of software engineering and the recommendations of the ACM's Software Engineering Education Knowledge (SEEK) document can provide solutions to minimize these discrepancies; in turn, improve the quality of a software system and increase user satisfaction. In this paper, a software development framework, called SETh, is presented. The SETh framework consists of a set of visual models that support software engineering education and practices in a systematic manner. It also enables backward tracking/tracing and forward tracking/tracing capabilities - two important concepts that can facilitate the greenfield and evolutionary type software engineering projects. The SETh framework connects every step of the development of a software system tightly; hence, the learners and the experienced software engineers can study, understand, and build efficient software systems for emerging data science applications."

The analysis of a user while interacting in VR, through data science and machine learning (ML) techniques, might provide insights to deliver customized functionalities that enhance productivity and efficiency in learning tasks in education or rehabilitation processes in healthcare. However, empirical research involving VR often borrows methods from human-computer interaction intending to evaluate human behavior through technology, whereas ML intend to create mathematical models, usually with non-empirical approach. Their opposite nature might cause confusion for early-stage researchers wanting to understand and follow the methodological approaches and communicative practices in empirical studies that merge both VR and ML. This paper presents a scoping review of methodological strategies undertaken in 21 peer-reviewed research articles that involve both VR and ML. Results show and appraise different methodological approaches in research projects, and outline a set of recommendations to combine metrics from inferential statistics and evaluation of ML models to increase validity, reliability and trustworthiness in future research projects that intersect VR and ML."

Queries must be run on an index, with any parameters of the retrieval models suitably tuned. With the advent of learning-to-rank, such experimental processes (including the appropriate folding of queries to achieve cross-fold validation) have resulted in complicated experimental designs and hence scripting. At the same time, machine learning platforms such as Scikit Learn and Apache Spark have pioneered the notion of an experimental pipeline , which naturally allows a supervised classification experiment to be expressed a series of stages, which can be learned or transformed. In this demonstration, we detail Terrier-Spark, a recent adaptation to the Terrier Information Retrieval platform which permits it to be used within the experimental pipelines of Spark. We argue that this (1) provides an agile experimental platform for information retrieval, comparable to that enjoyed by other branches of data science; (2) aids research reproducibility in information retrieval by facilitating easily-distributable notebooks containing conducted experiments; and (3) facilitates the teaching of information retrieval experiments in educational environments."

The big data (unstructured and semi-structured) contains lots of valuable information that can be mined and analyzed. However, such processing and utilization of data introduce challenges of dealing with noise (irrelevant, unnecessary and redundant data). Regardless of the nature of data processing and utilization for a given problem or an application, noise adds unnecessary time and cost. This paper briefly discusses the overall research work and then presents Noise Removal and Structured Data Detection (NR-and-SDD) algorithm and related math construct. NR-and-SDD detects the noise to reduce the processing cost and improve structured data detection in relevance of personality features. The given results show improved reliability and efficiency of NR and SDD processes. Related study is provided and paper is concluded with final remarks and future works."
9ad6e038a8786845ffcf1b8baceed9e2dffe94a2,cloud and onpremises data center usage expenditures and approaches to return on investment a survey of academic research computing organizations,"The landscape of research in science and engineering is heavily reliant on computation and data processing. There is continued and expanded usage by disciplines that have historically used advanced computing resources, new usage by disciplines that have not traditionally used HPC, and new modalities of the usage in Data Science, Machine Learning, and other areas of AI. Along with these new patterns have come new advanced computing resource methods and approaches, including the availability of commercial cloud resources. The Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation (CASC) has long been an advocate representing the needs of academic researchers using computational resources, sharing best practices and offering advice to create a national cyberinfrastructure to meet US science, engineering, and other academic computing needs. CASC has completed the first of what we intend to be an annual survey of academic cloud and data center usage and practices in analyzing return on investment in cyberinfrastructure. Critically important findings from this first survey include the following: many of the respondents are engaged in some form of analysis of return in research computing investments, but only a minority currently report the results of such analyses to their upper-level administration. Most respondents are experimenting with use of commercial cloud resources but no respondent indicated that they have found use of commercial cloud services to create financial benefits compared to their current methods. There is clear correlation between levels of investment in research cyberinfrastructure and the scale of both cpu core-hours delivered and the financial level of supported research grants. Also interesting is that almost every respondent indicated that they participate in some sort of national cooperative or nationally provided research computing infrastructure project and most were involved in academic computing-related organizations, indicating a high degree of engagement by institutions of higher education in building and maintaining national research computing ecosystems. Institutions continue to evaluate cloud-based HPC service models, despite having generally concluded that so far cloud HPC is too expensive to use compared to their current methods."
75791953e537b60660ec47423bafa7d9408be8dc,small data analysis for bigger data analysis,"The terms “data science” and “big data” become very popular these days. Importance of these concepts are popularly recognized mainly due to the success of AI technologies. Especially, machine learning (ML) technologies such as deep learning have been applied practically in these years and equipment using these ICT technologies becomes very sophisticated. Thus, our life becomes more convenient. Huge amount of data is required in order to apply ML technologies into practical use. As a result, “big data” and “big data analysis” are recognized quite important. Even with such an environment, “small data (or non-big data)” and “small data analysis” remain important. Small data and small data analysis have advantages such as ease of data collection, ease of data analysis/mining, and appropriateness for experimental analysis in the style of trial and error, especially for domain-specific exploratory analysis. In this paper, we discuss advantages of small data analysis in comparison with big data analysis based on our experience of analysis mainly of those data obtained in our educational practices. We conclude that it is an efficient and effective method for developing data analysis methods to start from small data and expanding them in their size and variety."
a5413802c8ad66ab759bcd75f18a8705f67db46e,mining online training log data,"Online training has been growing in popularity, and offers many advantages for both trainers and learners. Assessing the usage and impact of online material can be difficult, especially if content is made available to anyone and is not part of a course requiring formal enrollment. The Cornell Virtual Workshop (CVW) first offered online training on topics in high-performance computing and computational science in 1994, and ten years ago we began logging usage. We are now performing our first in-depth analysis of those log data to identify patterns in usage, so that we can better understand how users access the material, which types of topics and materials result in the greatest impact, how topic usage changes over time, and what types of presentation format might be preferred. While the CVW is built around a cohesive, sequential narrative for each training topic, we find that many users access our content in a more targeted fashion, suggesting that we rethink how we package our material. We anticipate that ongoing analysis using data science and machine learning methods will enable us to produce more useful training materials, and provide the educational community with valuable information about patterns in online material usage."

The main goal of this new field of knowledge is to contribute to new empirical findings, theories, methods, and metrics for understanding how students learn and to use that knowledge to improve those students' learning. Multimodal Learning Analytics, which emphasizes the analysis of natural rich modalities of communication during situated learning activities, is one of the most challenging but, at time, more promising areas of Learning Analytics. The Third International Workshop on Multimodal Learning Analytics brings together researchers in multimodal interaction and systems, cognitive and learning sciences, educational technologies, and related areas to discuss the recent developments and future opportunities in this sub-field. 
 
Following the First International Workshop on Multimodal Learning Analytics in Santa Monica in 2012 and the ICMI Grand Challenge on Multimodal Learning Analytics in Sydney in 2013, this third workshop comprises a mixture of a workshop session and two data-driven grand challenges. The program committee reviewed and accepted the following articles. 
 
The workshop session focuses on the presentation of multimodal signal analysis techniques that could be applied in Multimodal Learning Analytics. In this workshop challenges presenters concentrate on the benefits and shortcomings of different research and technical methods used for multimodal analysis of learning signals. This session includes four articles from diverse topics: theoretical and conceptual considerations for different forms of multimodal data fusion; voice analysis to determine the level of rapport in learning exercises; video analysis of live classrooms; and the role of multimodal analysis in the service of studying complex learning environments. 
 
Following the successful experience of the previous Multimodal Learning Analytics Grand Challenge in ICMI 2013, this year, this event will provide two data sets with a wealth of research questions to be tackled by interested participants: Math Data Challenge and Presentation Quality Challenge. For the Math Data Challenge, one article presented in this session provides a detailed exploration of how to use the digital pen information to predict the expertise in the group. This work reaches high levels of accuracy (83%) when identifying the expert student among the participants. For the Presentation Quality Challenge three articles are presented. The first one explores the slide presentation files and the audio features to predict the grade obtained by each student. The second work makes use of all the provided modalities (audio, video, Kinect data and slide files) and suggests that multimodal cues can predict human scores on presentation tasks. The final article uses the video and Kinect information to predict human grading. 
 
The third Multimodal Learning Analytics Workshop and Grand Challenges (MLA'14) was envisioned as a venue to initiate research in this nascent subfield of Learning Analytics. New challenges and insights will arise from the convergence of practitioners, academics and researchers, which in turn will create opportunities to collaborate and to create applications and tools to assist students, teachers and the community."
5f71c4164d7e71c15c8e69342894c19a7adaf627,no computation without representation avoiding data and algorithm biases through diversity,"The emergence and growth of research on issues of ethics in Artificial Intelligence, and in particular algorithmic fairness, has roots in an essential observation that structural inequalities in our society are reflected in the data used to train predictive models and in the design of objective functions. While research aiming to mitigate these issues is inherently interdisciplinary, the design of unbiased algorithms and fair socio-technical systems are key desired outcomes which depend on practitioners from the fields of data science and computing. However, these computing fields broadly also suffer from the same under-representation issues that are found in the datasets we analyze. This disconnect affects the design of both the desired outcomes and metrics by which we measure success. If the ethical AI research community accepts this, we tacitly endorse the status quo and contradict the goals of non-discrimination and equity which work on algorithmic fairness, accountability, and transparency seeks to address. Therefore, we advocate in this work for diversifying computing as a core priority of the field and our efforts to achieve ethical AI practices. We draw connections between the lack of diversity within academic and professional computing fields and the type and breadth of the biases encountered in datasets, machine learning models, problem formulations, and the interpretation of results. Examining the current fairness/ethics in AI literature, we highlight cases where this lack of diverse perspectives has been foundational to the inequity in the treatments of underrepresented and protected group data. We also look to other professional communities, such as in the law and health domains, where disparities have been reduced both in the educational diversity of trainees and among their professional practices. We use these lessons to develop a set of key recommendations that provide concrete steps for the computing community to increased diversity: 1) building collaborations with minority serving institutions, 2) prioritizing research collaboration between the ethics in AI community and underrepresented/interdisciplinary groups, and 3) providing enhanced mentorship to trainees at research conferences."

9645ebf3d7a524dc1e8fc965efaeb5319acc59e3,edison data science framework edsf addressing demand for data science and analytics competences for the data driven digital economy,"Emerging data driven economy including industry, research and business, requires new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. Data Science is becoming a new recognised field of science that leverages the Data Analytics methods with the power of the Big Data technologies and Cloud Computing that both provide a basis for effective use of the data driven research and economy models. Data Science research and education require a multi-disciplinary approach and data driven/centric paradigm shift. Besides core professional competences and knowledge in Data Science, increasing digitalisation of Science and Industry also requires new type of workplace and professional skills that rise the importance of critical thinking, problem solving and creativity required to work in highly automated and dynamic environment. The education and training of the data related professions must reflect all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science and handling practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple forms, also providing sufficient lab facilities for practical training. This paper discusses aspects of building customizable and interoperable Data Science curricula for different types of learners and target application domains. The proposed approach is based on using the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) initially developed in the EU funded Project EDISON and currently being maintained by the EDISON Community Initiative."
a78b92838a25d0b69ad7790a2a39d2731ab4a149,improving the quality of education system using data science technologies survey,"Education is the most important and silent weapon in a country for both individual and country’s economy. However lower level of adoption in the education system, poor decision making with less accuracy levels, adoption to new curriculums or subjects, teaching and learning styles are the main issues in education systems. These factors also have further long-term consequences for a country such as unemployment rates rises high, lack of suitable workforce for the demanding fields, individual dissatisfaction while being unemployed as well as in the community and socially. Unemployment rates are risen in Australia from past few years and this as a factor will be an ongoing issue if the government does not take any further actions to overcome these issues will definitely be direct hit to their economy in relation to work force in the present and future. Therefore the right technology should be implemented in order to obtain extract insights, obtain accurate decisions and high level adoption in education sector, as an example technologies such as data warehousing, big data, data mining, business intelligence and data analytics are in the peak of other industries such as aviation, retail, banking and other financial institutions. The main objective of this project is to facilitate a guide or a review for having data science technologies implemented in education sector in order to accomplish better education, as well as emphasis potential advantages of data technologies if it has been implemented in and around education systems."

When the student population changes from Computer Science students to those in an Information Technology program where many of the core CS courses are not required, additional challenges arise. Couple these challenges with teaching non-traditional students who are also involved with their families and careers; the difficulty in teaching this material rises exponentially. For our experiment, we chose to teach the Hadoop Distributed File System, the Map/Reduce paradigm, and basic Hadoop programming to expose these students to Data Science technologies. We will discuss our recent experience teaching Data Science to Information Technology students and the challenges we had to overcome, including missing distributed systems knowledge, a lack of basic Unix and operating systems understanding and a complete unfamiliarity with a Distributed File System."

Addressing and understanding such changes in a reliable manner requires contemporary data-science knowledge and methodologies since the amount of information available online has been increasing at an exponential rate. Additionally, to draw meaningful conclusions and predict certain events in terms of environmental changes, one must be familiar with existing natural processes. Thus, combining data science with knowledge about global conditions in the world and how they impact Earth’s biosphere, would highly benefit the understanding of possible consequences in the environment. Since our planet is a complex, dynamic system that is likely to change, one must be knowledgeable about the global climate system as a whole. As well, one must understand its processes and interactions with the environment to be able to understand and work on preventing the potential inevitable drastic circumstances for living. This paper addresses the issue of environmental changes and presents a solution in the form of academic education, which is currently in progress, and also related to the COVID-19 issues. As shown in the results section, this type of education aims to teach students about the basics of data science and how to interpret and visualize information related to current environmental changes."

Hence, introducing data science with games would generate an interest and prepare students for the rapidly changing world of technology. This study is especially intended to teach data science (DS) and R programming using games for cognitive learning. Tangible learning with real-life examples were used to teach Data Science. A correlation between the typical toys that are played are tied to concepts of DS. The three variables of social cognitive learning are integrated in this study. The data collected from the workshops are different from other studies because of broadly two reasons. First, the games used to teach data science were measured with the elements of cognitive learning. The other, was that the learning data collected from the students that participated in the study had a modified environment. The data that was collected during the experimental study for thirty hours for about 100 students. Students at the end of each session were able to identify the data science terms with respect to the games. They were able to write a small R program that they self-taught themselves due to the environmental factor of cognitive learning."
e688b46b52a1942774b1239741bceb236f5e6ddb,widening the shrinking pipeline the case of data science,"Gender imbalance in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) studies and occupations is a well-known phenomenon with a large body of research that tries to explain it and offer remedial interventions. Data science is a new and interdisciplinary STEM-oriented domain, integrating knowledge and skills from computer science, mathematics, and statistics with an application domain, from which the data draw their context and meaning. Data science applications are relevant for various domains, and therefore, a variety of populations are increasingly attracted to learning it. Addressing the theme of the conference, i.e., “Women in Engineering”, in this paper we describe a data science workshop for social sciences and digital humanities researchers. A significant majority (83%) of the participants of this workshop self-identified as women. This gender proportion, the opposite of that prevailing in STEM studies, led us to examine the workshop from a gender perspective. Our results indicate that the women participating in the data science workshop perceived it as an opportunity to acquire research tools rather than programming tools. We suggest that framing the workshop as a research tool workshop and not as a programming workshop reduced prevalent gender barriers in STEM, encouraging a majority of women researchers to participate. In this paper, we elaborate on the participants’ perceptions about data science and programming and analyze them based on three theoretical perspectives: expectancy value theory, the interdisciplinary perspective, and the epistemological perspective. Keywords–data science, data science education, gender balance, interdisciplinary of data science."

We seek to improve curricula by enriching it with authentic, real-world contexts and powerful scaffolds that can guide learners to success using automated tools, thereby reducing the strain on limited human instructional resources. To address these issues, we have created the BlockPy programming environment, a web-based, open-access, open-source platform for introductory computing students (https://www.blockpy.com). BlockPy has an embedded data science context that allows learners to connect the educational content with real-world scenarios through meaningful problems. The environment is block-based and gives guiding feedback to learners as they complete problems, but also mediates transfer to more sophisticated programming environments by supporting bidirectional, seamless transitions between block and text programming. Although it can be used as a stand-alone application, the environment has first-class support for the latest Learning Tools Interoperability standards, so that instructors can embed the environment directly within their Learning Management System. In this paper, we describe interesting design issues that we encountered during the development of BlockPy, an evaluation of the environment from fine-grained logs, and our future plans for the environment."

Each of these programs requires a robust computing component to be integrated into the curriculum. However, including an introductory, programmingoriented sequence designed for CS majors is not always the best fit for these multifaceted programs. In this work in progress paper, we set out to investigate possibilities and issues for the computing component, focusing on three fields: bioinformatics, data science, and cybersecurity. We explore commonalities and differences, and discuss initial plans to test our hypotheses. In doing so, we consider data organization, data acquisition, and a preliminary survey design."

In this paper we propose the idea that streaming can enable cognitive apprenticeship, a form of teaching where an expert works on authentic tasks while thinking aloud to explain their creative process. To understand how streamers teach in this naturalistic way, we performed a content analysis of 20 stream videos across four popular categories: web development, data science, digital art, and gaming. We discovered four kinds of serendipitous teachable moments that are reminiscent of cognitive apprenticeship: 1) creators encountered unexpected errors that led to improvised problem solving, 2) they generated improvised examples on-the-fly, 3) they sometimes went on insightful tangents, 4) they paused to give high-level advice that was contextualized within the work they were currently performing. We also found missed opportunities for additional teachable moments due to creators not being able to express their tacit (unspoken) expert knowledge because of pattern irreducibility, context dependence, and routinization."
7e1e773ab5875eacb1fa95feeb168e512cbdd771,adaptivevle an integrated framework for personalized online education using mps jetbrains domainspecific modeling environment,"This article contains the design and development of an Adaptive Virtual Learning Environment (AdaptiveVLE) framework to assist educators of all disciplines with creating adaptive VLEs tailored to their needs and to contribute towards the creation of a more generic framework for adaptive systems. Fully online education is a major trend in education technology of our times. However, it has been criticised for its lack of personalisation and therefore not adequately addressing individual students’ needs. Adaptivity and intelligence are elements that could substantially improve the student experience and enhance the learning taking place. There are several attempts in academia and in industry to provide adaptive VLEs and therefore personalise educational provision. All these attempts require a multiple-domain (multi-disciplinary) approach from education professionals, software developers, data scientists to cover all aspects of the system. An integrated environment that can be used by all the multiple-domain users mentioned above and will allow for quick experimentation of different approaches is currently missing. Specifically, a transparent approach that will enable the educator to configure the data collected and the way it is processed without any knowledge of software development and/or data science algorithms implementation details is required. In our proposed work, we developed a new language/framework using MPS JetBrains Domain-Specific Language (DSL) development environment to address this problem. Our work consists of the following stages: data collection configuration by the educator, implementation of the adaptive VLE, data processing, adaptation of the learning path. These stages correspond to the adaptivity stages of all adaptive systems such as monitoring, processing and adaptation. The extension of our framework to include other application areas such as business analytics, health analytics, etc. so that it becomes a generic framework for adaptive systems as well as more usability testing for all applications will be part of our future work."

Such responsible contribution to the broader social and ecological resilience in response to climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic needs to be both substantial and explicit. To formulate a research and education agenda across relevant disciplines, the paper presents findings of a bibliometric analysis of 1391 articles from the Web of Science database, revealing the intellectual and disciplinary compositions of the state-of-art research. Several disciplinary developments have been identified, along with the existing and emerging cross-disciplinary collaboration. Future work must be advanced across disciplines such as accounting, management, public relations, communications, public administration, and social data science, to leverage the information and communication technologies to account for ESG data and records as the essential groundwork for a carbon-neutral or net-zero future. A preliminary research and education agenda is then proposed to improve the CSR and ESG practices, as the groundwork for organizations to engage stakeholders such as consumers, clients, investors, professionals, and regulators."
5e5aefccdd1f46e160a7527c13e223a4b746fe2a,interdisciplinary cs course for nonmajors the case of graduate psychology students,"The objective of interdisciplinary education is to teach multiple domains, so that the students can solve integrative problems that require knowledge and skills from these domains. Interdisciplinary programs, in which computer science is combined with other domains, range from bioinformatics to computational linguistics and data science. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, mathematics, statistics, and the domain knowledge of the data involved. It is a relevant research skill for many disciplines, including social sciences. Specifically, graduate psychology students who wish to learn data science have already mastered the psychology domain knowledge and their statistics background is advanced. They lack, however, the computer science knowledge required for meaningfully handling data science. The problem is, however, that there is no CS1 course that fits graduate psychology students who study data science: On the one hand, the current CS1 courses do not suit social science students; on the other hand, CS1 courses for non-majors usually do not meet the required level of computer science needed for data science. Accordingly, to close this gap, we designed a new CS1 course – an interdisciplinary Introduction to Computer Science for Psychological Science course – that a) suits social science students and b) meets the required computer science level for data science. We evaluated the course by examining students’ learning outcomes, reflections, and responses on questionnaires. Based on the data analysis according to the self-determination motivation theory, it is concluded that the course design enabled to achieve the course’s targets."

Application of analytical techniques will facilitate insights-driven decision making on specific critical educational requirements such as personalized learning environment and configuration of teaching styles to learning styles. Analytics significantly impacts the quality of the teaching, teacher competence, and far-reaching benefits to learners. The primary purpose of this research work is to predict the teaching effectiveness of faculty members from students’ feedback using machine learning and text analytics. This research recognized the need for analytics-enabled measurement of faculty effectiveness and identified a taxonomy of parameters for evaluation for data analysis. The respondent were post-graduate students of Higher Education institutions in India (N=427). The data collected from a structured questionnaire was analyzed using the appropriate data science algorithms. The results showed that students showed positive sentiments towards the faculty members who enabled learner-engagement activities, practical orientation, and real-life scenarios. The contribution of the study is two-fold Firstly, the study extended the application of machine learning and text analytics to a comparatively lesser researched domain of faculty evaluation. Secondly, this work identified and analyzed relevant context-relevant parameters from a post-graduate teaching-learning perspective."

As such, the need for curricula and learning designs for teaching data science has never been greater. One increasingly useful institutional initiative for building critical skills is living learning communities. This study reports on a data science learning community, called The Data Mine. As part of this learning community, students worked on similar tasks, took classes together, and participated in industry related assignments. This exploratory study aims to understand how students navigated learning challenges, what self-regulation strategies were adopted, and what students ultimately learned through participating in the Data Mine Learning Community. Students were grouped into achievement categories using a developed rubric on course assignments and their responses to open ended questions were evaluated for patterns among those in their achievement group. The results indicate that the highest performing students avoided coding errors and were highly focused on learning gains."

In particular, remote learning and the use of digital platforms have greatly increased in importance. Online teaching and e-learning provide many benefits for information retention and schedule flexibility in our on-demand world while breaking down barriers caused by geographic location, physical facilities, transportation issues, or physical impediments. However, educators and researchers have noticed that students face a learning and performance decline as a result of this sudden shift to online teaching and e-learning from classrooms around the world. In this paper, we focus on reviewing eye-tracking techniques and systems, data collection and management methods, datasets, and multi-modal learning data analytics for promoting pervasive and proactive learning in educational environments. We then describe and discuss the crucial challenges and open issues of current learning environments and data learning methods. The review and discussion show the potential of transforming traditional ways of teaching and learning in the classroom, and the feasibility of adaptively driving learning processes using eye-tracking, data science, multimodal learning analytics, and artificial intelligence. These findings call for further attention and research on collaborative and intelligent learning systems, plug-and-play devices and software modules, data science, and learning analytics methods for promoting the evolution of face-to-face learning and e-learning environments and enhancing student collaboration, engagement, and success."
f35c0d809499808ced8d6ff9ccd3ab640bfe29ba,computing degree apprenticeships an opportunity to address gender imbalance in the it sector,"This paper explores the potential for new work-based apprenticeship degrees to encourage more women into computing degrees and the IT sector. In the UK, women are currently under-represented on computing courses. Meanwhile the IT industry requires more computing graduates, in general, and specifically more highly skilled women to create appropriate products and systems. The UK has recently introduced apprenticeship computing degrees, where the apprentice is a work-based employee. In some models, apprentices spend 20% of their time on Higher Education studies and also gain credits through work-based learning; in others, apprentices spend blocks of time in Higher Education and the workplace. These degrees offer a new and innovative route to studying computing at university. Largely funded by employers, apprentices are salaried, and their fees are paid, paving the way for more people to study for a degree. The work context enables apprentices to keep their jobs (if relevant) or to move into IT roles and start a computing degree without necessarily having computing qualifications; the degrees have no upper age limit. Extending the work-based approach of US cooperative education and student work placement models, apprenticeship degrees have been introduced to increase skills levels through a close partnership between universities and employers. This is particularly important in IT, where the sector is expanding, and employers are looking for both good technical and personal skills. With this model, employers are collaboratively involved in the design of the degrees and apprentices graduate with extensive work experience.We posed the following research question: Are there differences in the paths into computing apprenticeship degrees between women and men? A survey was conducted with apprentices beginning a degree in Fall 2019: Cyber Security, Data Science, IT Management for Business, or Software Engineering/Development. Participants were asked about their routes into the apprenticeship and the IT sector. Apprentices at five universities in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland completed the survey, on paper or online (n=85; 23 female, 59 male).The results revealed a less severe gender imbalance than with comparative on-campus degrees (28% female), but this varied greatly across the subjects, from Data Science, where 55% of respondents identified as female and IT Management for Business (40% female), to Software Development (27% female) and Cyber Security (only 11% female). Apprentices were more likely to have started the degree at least a few years after leaving school and this was especially true for women. More female respondents had also been with their current employer for over five years. However, women were slightly more likely to have joined their employers in order to start the apprenticeship.This initial work identifies opportunities to recruit women onto computing degree apprenticeships, for example by targeting women who have started careers. It also highlights that there are challenges in recruiting women into certain subject areas, especially Cyber Security, but also Software Development. Exploring our respondents’ motivations for choosing their subjects illuminates the gender balance challenge and indicates how degree apprenticeships can encourage more women into the IT sector."

The appraisal and assessment processes of students are the foundation for enhancing the level of teaching and learning in many HEI. Learning Management Systems (LMS) provide valuable data, but usually they need further processing to interpret this data in a manner that aligns with the principles of quality assurance and accreditation bodies. Learning analytics is concerned with the analysis of data collected from LMS. This paper presents a framework for extending the open-source Moodle learning management system to evaluate the achievement of the academic programs objectives and students’ outcomes in order to improve the teaching and learning processes and to leverage decision making related to educational management. The proposed framework relays in two integrated systems: Customized Moodle system for calculating course and student’s outcomes and a backend system for calculating learning outcomes at the program level and generating reports."

This new version of the robot uses a wifi module providing a way to communicate data received from the sensors as the robot executes its program. It is argued that this feature may be useful to use the robot in competitions extending its use to different learning contents. The robot was built and tested by students in a hands-on introduction to technology and programming in a Computer Science course for first-year students at the University of the Azores. Since the curriculum was a mix of introductory topics related to digital technology, programming, and data science, the robot must include the following features: be a kit to assemble and test, be easy to program, and provide real-time data that can be analyzed using basic data science techniques.Students completed a questionnaire (N = 13) used to evaluate interaction difficulties with the robot and how students see their importance for learning activity. The survey was based on a previously tested heuristic model. It pointed out some issues to consider in future interactions with the robot in classes and competitions."

With the help of professional data scientists, developing countries could benefit from big data effectively and leapfrog from traditional methods of data generation to modern data handling methods without going through the same process as in wealthier regions. The sky-high demand for data scientists is due to the enormous business value that they can bring to the table, deriving deep learning from the big data. In this paper, we give one solution how to train a data scientist for the Global South where data scientists face partly different challenges as their colleagues in the Global North. Based on more than ten years of collaboration in ICT education with various African partners, we developed the general framework for an innovative BSc degree programme in computer science with specialisation in data science including two essential threads - learning-by-being and learning-by-doing. Only by combining learning to both doing and being, we can train data scientists that are able to change the target context in a profound way. A built-in research program on the data science training increase Global South – North collaboration, which in turn combined with open collaboration and flexible way of overcoming hierarchical boundaries most probably leads to the innovative joint ventures."

Educational organizations such as universities have a need to provide educational cloud curriculums for their students. In our current research, we are constructing a private cloud based on super-saturation, which is defined as the allocation of a much greater amount of logical resources than physical resources. Super-saturated clouds therefore realize up to 10 times more running instances than conventional clouds. While the performance of super-saturated clouds decreases somewhat compared with conventional clouds, their costs also greatly decrease. Moreover, in the post-cloud era, i.e., the big data era, data scientists will be increasingly required to process big data in the cloud. Mahout and Hadoop are two popular tools used in the fields of data science and machine learning. However, a certain level of skill is required to build such machine learning systems, and because it takes a long time to build such systems, the curriculums available to learners are limited. In this paper, we propose a method of rapid deployment for machine learning systems in the educational cloud. We show that our proposed method can reduce the required preparation time."

Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes."

A million bytes of data can be originated every day in every field of applications such as education, medical, business, government, organizations etc. In educational field the performance of the students is the midway so that it is essential to identify the risk of the students using predictive analytics. If the student risk is identified their performance can be predicted using machine learning algorithms. Machine Learning algorithms are the tools that process the data in an efficient aspect and play a multimodal feature in the field of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Predictive analytics etc. For data analytics the machine learning algorithms could not find the text, image or video. Hence it is essential to preprocess the data set which can be then used for analytics for identifying future inferences using Machine learning algorithms. A data set is a collection of samples or objects which can be characterized by the features called variables or attributes. The features are the key elements of the data sets through which the predictions can be obtained by selecting the specified features for correlated prediction. This paper expounds the working methods of data preprocessing and feature selection for predicting the student’s performance and also compares the metrics with its threshold value which would be used for future research work."

Nevertheless, rapid economic growth in many fields requires graduates with specialized skills, particularly in the Gulf region and especially in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has two main projects, Saudi Vision 2030 and NEOM. Such projects need graduates equipped with skills and experience to cope with economic growth, digital transformation, technological advancements, and future needs. Therefore, Saudi Vision is focusing on the second pillar of Saudi Vision 2030: creating a thriving economy to increase employment and reduce the unemployment rate from 11.6% to 7%. Some studies have sought to highlight or to solve graduate unemployment problems using traditional methods. Even though many of them are time-consuming and endeavouring, the outcome received is exceedingly faint. Hence, this study utilizes information technology to build a framework called Collaborative Intelligent Computer study Graduates and Labour Market Framework (CICCLM). CICCLM uses a machine learning approach and data science methods to identify the weaknesses to close the gap between university computing graduates and employer expectations through an analysis of the labour market requirements aligning them to the graduates ‘capabilities. Furthermore, CICCLM provides recommendations and visualization platform about the mismatch between academic education and industry requirements. Additionally, CICCLM provides recommendations to update the curriculum and course plan, while providing training courses for old graduate students."

There are many factors that can influence the learning trajectory in MOOCs settings, and in order to gain a deeper understanding of learners' experience, we employ a quantitative research method, in which sentiment analysis and topic modeling are applied. In this perspective, learners' reviews from the learning platform Coursera are examined to identify the main topics associated with the course and the learners' attitudes and opinions towards these topics. For this purpose, a total of 28,281 reviews scraped from five courses within the field of data science are analyzed, and consequently nine course topics for which learners have commented on are found. The identified topics include: content, delivery, assessment, learning experience, tools, video material, teaching style, instructor skills and course provider. Next, each topic is assigned a sentiment score using a lexicon-based approach, and the topics which mostly affect the learning experience are finally determined and discussed."

However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the recent evidence-based visual programming approaches that are applied in several domains. This study presents a systematic review to understand, compare, and reflect on recent visual programming approaches using twelve dimensions: visual programming classification, interaction style, target users, domain, platform, empirical evaluation type, test participants’ type, number of test participants, test participants’ programming skills, evaluation methods, evaluation measures, and accessibility of visual programming tools. The results show that most of the selected articles discussed tools that target IoT and education, while other fields such as data science, robotics are emerging. Further, most tools use abstractions to hide implementation details and use similar interaction styles. The predominant platforms for the tools are web and mobile, while desktop-based tools are on the decline. Only a few tools were evaluated with a formal experiment, whilst the remaining ones were evaluated with evaluation studies or informal feedback. Most tools were evaluated with students with little to no programming skills. There is a lack of emphasis on usability principles in the design stage of the tools. Additionally, only one of the tools was evaluated for expressiveness. Other areas for exploration include supporting end users throughout the life cycle of applications created with the tools, studying the impact of tutorials on improving learnability, and exploring the potential of machine learning to improve debugging solutions developed with visual programming."

The growing demand to protect, exploit and learn about some of our most precious resources calls for particular knowledge and skills to respond to the challenges of a harsh and unforgiving environment. The new Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s Degree (EMJMD) Programme in Marine and Maritime Intelligent Robotics (MIR) (http://www.master-mir.eu) combines robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advance marine and maritime science and its technological applications. It aims at building the capacity to enable advances in far reaching sea exploration, autonomous deep sea robots, teleoperations and the use of AI in these endeavours. The MIR programme is shaped to provide training in data science and state of the art applied robotics targeted at enhancing the efficiency, health, safety and environmental performance of the offshore industry and maritime operations. The EMJMD MIR programme offers competitive scholarships to welcome students worldwide and provides them with a common space to develop their shared passion for marine robotics and AI. The programme fosters cultural exchange and sharing of individual experiences. The master’s is conducted by a consortium of 4 well-established academic institutions in the domain of marine robotics research. The institutions are in 4 countries France (UTLN), Norway (NTNU), Portugal (UL-IST) and Spain (UJI), for which the ocean has played a key role in history and is anchored in society. The goal of the programme is to develop specialists in marine and maritime intelligent robotic systems, providing them with: a) a solid theoretical background in the marine physical processes and technical skills in robotics engineering control systems and sensors, b) grounded knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, enabling them to develop cutting edge robotics solutions to real world challenges, c) applied knowledge in subsea and maritime application fields, including blue growth of maritime and offshore sectors, as well as deep sea surveillance, biodiversity monitoring, subsea resources exploration, offshore structure maintenance, e-navigation and maritime security enhancement.Students completing the MIR Masters will be well equipped with skills and state of the art knowledge, enabling them to pursue a career in robotics engineering for the offshore oil and gas, renewable, naval, and maritime sectors. Additionally, the knowledge acquired in the use and function of intelligent robotics for the underwater environment will enable them to easily continue on to a PhD in multiple different fields, should they so desire.The programme was designed to address global challenges identified by the consortium, the gap between industry and academia, the slow convergence of AI and robotics communities and the geopolitical and cultural differences among participating countries. The MIR programme contains a growing worldwide network of more than 58 academic and industrial associate partners spanning more than 21 counmes and covering all oceans. Associate partners participate by providing industry-led lectures, internships, research collaborations and scholarships. Learning-by-doing courses cover the fundamentals of the marine environment, robotics and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on the interconnections between these fields. A set of transversal skills is developed through courses in languages, scientific writing and entrepreneurship. Furthermore. the MIR consortium organises a yearly symposium hosting presentations from the students’ work, keynotes from distinguished scholars, industry representatives and competitive challenges in AI and robotics.While the first year of the course takes place at UTLN, each student specialises in one of the three study tracks, encompassing a 3rd semester at one of the other main partners’ institutions. Applied robotics for underwater intervention missions (UJI) aims to endow underwater robots with the capability to interact with the environment using manipulators, thus paving the way for the development of advanced systems for close-range underwater infrastructures inspection and maintenance as well as materials sampling. Safe Autonomous subsea operations (NTNU) targets increasing the level of automation and autonomy in routine or otherwise tedious operations which can improve safety, efficiency and performance, supporting the human operator in decision-making and supervision and reducing human workload. Cooperative marine robotics for scientific and commercial applications (IST-UL) focuses on groups of autonomous marine robots working in cooperation, networked via aerial, acoustic, and optical links to dramatically improve the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales.MIR students write a master thesis related to their study track and supervised by one of the main partners and their work is presented at the MIR annual symposium. Graduates receive a double diploma from UTLN and the institution of their study track. The MIR programme fills a gap in the current EU education landscape by responding to a pressing demand for specialists in ocean technology. It does so by building a consortium of actors around the globe with the common goal of advancing education and research in AI and robotics for ocean applications."

Technical debt, which encompasses internal software quality, evolution and maintenance, reengineering, and economics, is growing such that its management is becoming the dominant driver of software engineering progress. It spans the software engineering life cycle, and its management capitalizes on recent advances in fields such as source code analysis, quality measurement, and project management. Managing technical debt will become an investment activity applying economic theories. It will effectively address the architecture level and will offer specific processes and tools employing data science and analytics to support decision making. It will also be an essential part of the software engineering curriculum. Getting ahead of the software quality and innovation curve will inevitably involve establishing technical-debt management as a core software engineering practice.

1e46a10515c7dc306f2ae0c2420e6d67abcd9730,predicting academic performance with artificial intelligence ai a new tool for teachers and students,"Learning Analytics (LA) is data science applied to the educational field. It enables the measurement, collection, and analysis of learners’ data and their context. In this research we utilized two algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence (AI): K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest. These algorithms trained a predictive model for the academic performance of students pursuing an engineering degree. This research found that a general picture of the performance of the group is enough to improve, despite the forecast for each student not being accurate. This allowed the instructor to adapt their teaching technique to get better results. Finally, most students agree to take advantage of LA and they think that knowing their predictive results at the beginning of the course will help them do better in class."

The retraining programme, developed by the Partner Universities in conjunction with the Industrial Partners, has modules at level 6/7 including: Technology: coding, data science, cyber security, machine learning, agile project management; Workplace readiness skills: public speaking, clear communication, working as a team. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the TechUPWomen programme, and we analyse its temporal evolution and special features via a data analytics nowcasting approach. Deepening these women’s experience with applied upskilling includes one-to-one mentoring (100-100), strong networking, residentials, close industry connection with two directions (non-technical & technical) and four job-focussed final tracks: business analyst, agile project manager, data scientist, developer. TechUPWomen also has significant representation of traditionally underrepresented communities, with focus on enabling instead of teaching approach. Beside the originality of the unique combination of features of the programme, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first analysis based on data analytics of a women in tech(nology) retraining programme, based on nowcasting. Results show that the approach is effective; topic analysis shows that frequent topics include joy, BAME, networking, residential, industry, learning."
af3b0b79204d9157ee9f374e961c9f0e8f237ea6,predicting dropout using high school and firstsemester academic achievement measures,"Due to the big data accumulated in educational administrative systems and due to the advance of machine learning techniques, a new scientific discipline has emerged in the last few years, namely educational data science. An important research objective of this field is to predict dropout and improve graduation rates, in particular in STEM higher education.The goal of this study is to identify students at risk of dropping out at a large Hungarian technical university using predictive analytical tools. We use data of 10,196 students who finished their undergraduate studies (either by graduation or dropping out) between 2013 and 2018. We analyze dropout predictability in two main scenarios: first using data available at the time of enrollment, e.g. pre-enrollment achievement measures, and personal details, then in another scenario we supplement this feature set with first-semester performance indicators and use this richer set of attributes for further analysis. We apply artificial neural networks and boosting algorithms for prediction, and examine how the predictive power can be improved by the additional information. In other words, we study the incremental predictive validity of the early university performance indicators on graduation over the pre-enrollment achievement measures and vice versa."
f8a9659920dde5965609d580d3f325979256a21e,an automated system for transferring and equivalence between saudi universities,"Text-Mining is one of the most important areas of machine learning and data science. It has gained great momentum recently, where it is being employed in many different majors of university degrees to create a new level of services and applications. The education field has a significant effect on many parts of society, especially within universities. One of the critical issues that can face any student during their academic life is transferring to another university. This research depends on the techniques of Text-Mining and proposes a new algorithm for calculating the similarity rate between two subjects' descriptions. The rate will be used for an electronic equivalent system between subjects of two universities. Moreover, the system will manage the whole process and functions of transferring starting from the request until the final decision. The proposed system will address the problems of the current system which relate to cost, time, effort, and equity. The integration between the proposed web application and the proposed algorithm will create comprehensive processing for this issue. Finally, the testing and comparison shows the viability of the proposed method to applying it in the real environments. According to specialists, the equivalent manual process takes between 2 to 4 months, from the moment of receiving the papers from students until publishing the end results. Briefly, we propose a web-based system for online applications, which would include an auto similarity calculating function to enable the students make request by themselves, which will enable them to check the approximate end result which will be very accurate because we avoid the bias and difference among persons from this process. That is the primary goal of this research."

25679057c9ee61af868e658c65b6b69bd26251af,a largescale comparison of python code in jupyter notebooks and scripts,"In recent years, Jupyter notebooks have grown in popularity in several domains of software engineering, such as data science, machine learning, and computer science education. Their popularity has to do with their rich features for presenting and visualizing data, however, recent studies show that notebooks also share a lot of drawbacks: high number of code clones, low reproducibility, etc. In this work, we carry out a comparison between Python code written in Jupyter Notebooks and in traditional Python scripts. We compare the code from two perspectives: structural and stylistic. In the first part of the analysis, we report the difference in the number of lines, the usage of functions, as well as various complexity metrics. In the second part, we show the difference in the number of stylistic issues and provide an extensive overview of the 15 most frequent stylistic issues in the studied mediums. Overall, we demonstrate that notebooks are characterized by the lower code complexity, however, their code could be perceived as more entangled than in the scripts. As for the style, notebooks tend to have 1.4 times more stylistic issues, but at the same time, some of them are caused by specific coding practices in notebooks and should be considered as false positives. With this research, we want to pave the way to studying specific problems of notebooks that should be addressed by the development of notebook-specific tools, and provide various insights that can be useful in this regard."
50c1d6b6f03d4da9cfd7b382e0403fd7db8d1c2e,framing professional learning analytics as reframing oneself,"Central to imagining the future of technology-enhanced professional learning is the question of how data are gathered, analyzed, and fed back to stakeholders. The field of learning analytics (LA) has emerged over the last decade at the intersection of data science, learning sciences, human-centered and instructional design, and organizational change, and so could in principle inform how data can be gathered and analyzed in ways that support professional learning. However, in contrast to formal education where most research in LA has been conducted, much work-integrated learning is experiential, social, situated, and practice-bound. Supporting such learning exposes a significant weakness in LA research, and to make sense of this gap, this article proposes an adaptation of the Knowledge-Agency Window framework. It draws attention to how different forms of professional learning locate on the dimensions of learner agency and knowledge creation. Specifically, we argue that the concept of “reframing oneself” holds particular relevance for informal, work-integrated learning. To illustrate how this insight translates into LA design for professionals, three examples are provided: first, analyzing personal and team skills profiles (skills analytics); second, making sense of challenging workplace experiences (reflective writing analytics); and third, reflecting on orientation to learning (dispositional analytics). We foreground professional agency as a key requirement for such techniques to be used effectively and ethically."

b800d34dabd53db743cdf161c0e968e78b464272,what science and stem teachers can learn from covid harnessing data science and computer science through the convergence of multiple stem subjects,"ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic is a historic global event that has extended to all parts of society and shaken the core of what we know and how we live. During this pandemic, the work of STEM professionals has taken center stage. Through our close observations of how the events of the pandemic have been unfolding across the globe, we propose an instructional framework that emerged out of the real-time responses of STEM professionals to explain the pandemic and find solutions. This framework centers on data science, computer science, and multidisciplinary convergence as tools for engaging K-12 students in complex societal problems like the pandemic. In this theoretical position statement, we propose our framework that is grounded in three areas: (a) data science and computer science, (b) multidisciplinary convergence, and (c) orientation and support for science teachers specifically and STEM teachers broadly to prepare them for fundamentally different roles. Using data and computer models, students find phenomena and problems compelling, appreciate the power and potential of STEM subjects, and explain phenomena and design solutions to real-world problems. Then, through multidisciplinary convergence, individuals and societies integrate STEM disciplinary knowledge and practices to make informed decisions and take responsible actions. As STEM teachers engage students in explaining phenomena and solving complex societal problems with data science and computer science through the convergence of multiple STEM subjects, teachers take on roles that are fundamentally different from the roles they have traditionally played."

Data science, including mathematics, statistics, big data, machine learning, and deep learning, can be considered as the intersection of statistics, mathematics and computer science. Although the debate continues about the core area of data science, the subject is a huge hit. Universities have a high demand for data science. They are trying to live up to this demand by opening postgraduate and doctoral programs. Since the subject is a new field, there are significant differences between the programs given by universities in data science. Besides, since the subject is close to statistics, most of the time, data science programs are opened in the statistics departments, and this also causes differences between the programs. In this article, we will summarize the data science education developments in the world and in Turkey specifically and how data science education should be at the graduate level."

The new field of data science involves advanced knowledge in statistics and computer science, combined with copious amounts of data. A report from the Big Data and Research Initiative under the Obama Administration, The Federal Big Data Research and Development Strategic Plan, calls attention to the roles that librarians will play in the future of data science. However, there are skills and management gaps librarians face that inhibit their ability to move forward in data science. A number of educational programs are now offered to remedy this problem, such as the Data and Visualization Institute for Librarians from North Carolina State University, the volunteer-led Library Carpentry program, and most recently, the Data Sciences in Libraries Project, funded by the IMLS. This project aims to get librarians and library managers together to discuss the world of data science and create a roadmap for strategic planning."

Instead of focusing on the data alone, behavior mining endorses the idea of exploring and mining the underlying natural, social and other kinds of behaviors which have produced the data, and discovering hidden interesting patterns behind these behaviors. Behavior mining for big data offers excellent opportunity for promoting critical thinking in data science education. In this paper we discuss the importance of behavior mining at the era of big data, describe implications of behavior mining for big data, and outline three case studies to illustrate its applications, and to show how behavior mining can promote critical thinking in data science education. Keywords—Big Data, data mining, behavior Mining, critical thinking, data science education"

Every year, digital technologies change everyday life, creating the foundations for sustainable socio-economic development. Changes resulting from the revolution in information technology signal the need for new approaches to training, particularly in Ukraine. Technologies are improving at a fairly rapid pace, but the methodological base at the level of Ukrainian high education institutions (HEIs) is adapting to such changes rather slowly, which, accordingly, slows down the process of ""smarting"" of education. In turn, graduates are not the most attractive for the modern labour market. This article highlights the urgent need for extensive training in this area. In turn, the paper aims to offer a case of the study programme for graduating data science analysts (DSAs). The original approach is the master degree programme case for the social science faculty but not for engineering faculty as it is traditionally. The necessity of DSAs is extremely high in the economic field/business however mostly graduates of the engineering faculties having strong programming skills lack the economic knowledge and understanding of business laws. The contribution of the paper is that the proposed program differs from existing ones on the market, but is not implemented in HEIs, with its systematical adaptability to the requirements of the state standard; as well it meets all the requirements of employers in the field of Data Science. The paper is mostly in the practical and descriptive area thus the methodological base of the research are general scientific research methods like historical method, comparative analysis, methods of analyses & synthesis, system approach and logical generalization."

As biomedical data-sets increase in size, variety and complexity, they challenge conventional methods for sharing, managing and analyzing those data. In May 2017, we convened a two-day meeting between the BD2K Training Coordinating Center (TCC), ELIXIR Training/TeSS, GOBLET, H3ABioNet, EMBL-ABR, bioCADDIE and the CSIRO, in Huntington Beach, California, to compare and contrast our respective activities, and how these might be leveraged for wider impact on an international scale. Discussions focused on the role of i) training for biomedical data science; ii) the need to promote core competencies, and the ii) development of career paths. These led to specific conversations about i) the values of standardizing and sharing data science training resources; ii) challenges in encouraging adoption of training material standards; iii) strategies and best practices for the personalization and customization of learning experiences; iv) processes of identifying stakeholders and determining how they should be accommodated; and v) discussions of joint partnerships to lead the world on data science training in ways that benefit all stakeholders. Generally, international cooperation was viewed as essential for accommodating the widest possible participation in the modern bioscience enterprise, providing skills in a truly “FAIR” manner, addressing the importance of data science understanding worldwide.

To help address this gap, this paper reports on a case study evaluating the effectiveness of pair programming within a data science course. Our findings show that pair programming can be useful for teaching data science students. In addition, while the driver role was similar to what has been described within a software development context, we note that the navigator role had an expanded set of responsibilities, which we termed researcher activities. Further research is required to explore if pair programming is also useful in other engineering domains and if the expanded navigator role is applicable in domains beyond data science/data engineering."

d427729cfc778036f15404aca0f487288faabc6a,estimation of supply and demand of tertiary education places in advanced digital profiles in the eu focus on artificial intelligence high performance computing cybersecurity and data science,"In order to investigate the extent to which the education offer of advanced digital skills in Europe matches labour market needs, this study estimates the supply and demand of university places for studies covering the technological domains of Artificial Intelligence (AI), High Performance Computing (HPC), Cybersecurity (CS) and Data Science (DS), in the EU27, United Kingdom and Norway. The difference between demand and supply of tertiary education places (Bachelor and Master or equivalent level) in the mentioned technological domains is referred in this report as unmet students' demand of places, or unmet demand. Demanded places, available places and unmet demand are estimated for the following dimensions: (a) the tertiary education level in which this demand is observed: Bachelor and Master or equivalent programmes; (b) the programmeâ€™s scope, or depth with which education programmes address the technological domain: broad and specialised; and (c) the main fields of education where this tuition is offered: Business Administration and Law; Natural sciences and Mathematics; Information and Communication Technology (ICT); and Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction, with the remaining fields grouped together in a fifth category. From these estimations, it is concluded that the number of available places in the EU27, at Bachelor level, reaches 587,000 for studies with AI content, 106,000 places offered in HPC, 307,000 places in CS and 444,000 places offered in the domain of DS. At Master level this demand is comparatively lower, except for the DS domain, were it equals the offer at bachelor level. DS outnumbers AI in demand of places at Master level, with 602,000 and 535,000 demanded places, respectively. The unmet demand for AI, HPC, CS and DS in EU27 at MSc level is approximately 150,000, 33,000, 59,000 and 167,000 places, respectively. At BSc level, the unmet demand reaches 273,000, 53,000, 159,000 and 213,000 places, respectively. Another finding is that the unmet demand for broad academic programmes is higher than for specialised programmes of all technological domains and education levels (Bachelor and Master). Higher availability of places for AI, HPC, CS and DS domains is found for academic programmes taught in the ICT field of education, both at Bachelor and Master levels. For Bachelor studies, Germany and Finland are estimated as the countries with the highest unmet demand in AI, HPC, CS and DS, either with a broad or specialised scope. United Kingdom is the only studied country offering places for all fields of education and technological domains at Bachelor level and Master level. For Master studies, this is also found in Germany, Ireland, France and Portugal."

At present, the profession faces the challenges of large market demand, professional construction team and unsound curriculum system. Under the background of new engineering, how to use the industry as the starting point for talent training research is an urgent problem to be solved. In view of the above problems, this paper analyzes the status quo of big data professional construction, puts forward the research on the construction of artificial intelligence in data science and big data technology under the background of new engineering, and integrates the direction of artificial intelligence into the big data profession to build a talent training position. In combination with the local needs of Heilongjiang Province, the school-enterprise cooperation mode and the construction of the teaching staff will be carried out, thus effectively improving the quality of personnel training. 1. Connotation of New Engineering Science and technology are the primary productive forces, the continuous advancement and development of science and technology, and the development of a new economic situation. At present, China's economic development is affected by new technologies and is undergoing continuous transformation. The Internet-centered technological industry changes are driving the development of new technologies and new economic models. In the new economic situation and the demand of the industry, in the face of the impact of the international situation, China's higher education has made new demands on the concept of innovative engineering education, the construction of engineering education disciplines, and the cultivation of talents. The new engineering construction is officially in this context. Produced by . In order to cultivate a large number of outstanding engineering and scientific talents who will lead the future development of technology and industry, and provide intellectual support and talent guarantee for China's industrial development and international competition, in February and April 2017, the Ministry of Education held respectively at Fudan University and Tianjin University. The new engineering seminars of comprehensive universities and engineering universities have formed the “Fudan Consensus” and “Tianda Action” for the construction of new engineering. The move is to propose a ""new engineering concept"" in response to the new opportunities and challenges facing the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation. The construction of ""new engineering"" is a strategic action to take the initiative to respond to a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. The new economy characterized by new technologies, new industries, new formats and new models calls for ""new engineering"", and a series of major national strategies are implemented in depth. Calling for ""new engineering"", industrial transformation and upgrading, and the transformation of old and new kinetic energy call for ""new engineering"", and upgrade the country's hard power and international competitiveness to call for ""new engineering."" On February 18, 2017, the Ministry of Education held a seminar on the development strategy of higher engineering education at Fudan University to discuss the connotation 2019 9th International Conference on Education, Management, and Computer (ICEMC 2019) Copyright © (2019) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/icemc.2019.137 754 characteristics of new engineering, the path selection of new engineering construction and development, and reached 10 consensuses. ""Fudan Consensus"" for the construction of ""New Engineering"". On April 8, 2017, the Ministry of Education held a new engineering construction seminar at Tianjin University to discuss the vision and actions of the new engineering construction, which was called the “big day action” for the construction of “new engineering”. Through more than a year of construction, the “New Engineering” has achieved remarkable results. Focusing on the construction of new engineering majors, the Ministry of Education has not only approved new engineering majors such as big data, artificial intelligence, and cyberspace security, but also provided new ways to introduce new technologies for traditional engineering majors through the Collaborative Education Project of Industry, University and Research. The traditional engineering major has transformed into a new engineering major. With the continuous development of network technology and informatization construction, some emerging technology industries and disciplines have also developed. Data science and big data technology are the requirements of current industrial development and are an emerging discipline. Big data and its related industries have gradually become an important part and driving force of the new economy. Therefore, cultivating qualified big data talents for the new economic development is the key to China's occupation of high-tech commanding heights in the new economic development. It is an important part of the new engineering construction. It is an important part of the new engineering construction. How to combine the new engineering concepts to carry out data science and The cultivation of big data technology professionals is a hot issue of current research and exploration . 2. Development and Research Status of Big Data Professional The difference between big data and ordinary data is mainly the data set with large capacity, multiple types, fast access speed and high application value. Big data can collect, store and correlate data in a large number, scattered sources and diverse formats, and then discover new knowledge, create new value, enhance new capabilities, and provide technology and services for information construction and industry. 2.1. Foreign Development and Research Status The foreign big data major developed from the data analysis major. In 2007, the University of North Carolina State University established a master's degree in setting up and traditional computer science and technology, software engineering, computer network technology, applied mathematics and Different from statistical analysis, big data technology starts from the bottom layer and abstracts the characteristic information outside the data surface layer, so as to make up for the weak links of the existing basic discipline research, carry out cross research with other industries and fields, and gradually develop into today's data science. Professional with big data technology. Since 2013, many famous universities such as Stanford University in foreign countries have successively opened data science and big data technology majors. The goal of professional training is to cultivate data collectors, data mining, data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization, and to train data scientists for cross-disciplinary research with other disciplines . 2.2. Domestic Development and Research Status The State Council issued a notice on the implementation of the Action Plan for Promoting Big Data Development. Guofa [2015] No. 50 explicitly encourages universities to set up data science and data engineering related majors, and focuses on cultivating professional data engineers and other big data professionals. It can be seen that the profession is favored by colleges and universities, and it is related to the country's strong support for the development of big data industry and the shortage of talents in the industry. In recent years, China's data science and big data technology professions have also sprung up. In February 2016, Peking University, University of International Business and Economics and Central South University became the first universities to be awarded “Data Science and Big Data Technology”; in March 2017, 32 universities including Renmin University of China,"

Program leaders have contributed data and information to the National Center to inform an approach to advancing the science of interprofessional practice and education (IPE), called IPE Knowledge Generation. This paper describes how the evolution of IPE Knowledge Generation blends traditional research and evaluation approaches with the burgeoning field of health informatics and big data science. The goal of IPE Knowledge Generation is to promote collaboration and knowledge discovery among IPE program leaders who collect comparable, sharable data in an information exchange. This data collection then supports analysis and knowledge generation. To enable the approach, the National Center uses a structured process for guiding IPE program design and implementation in practice settings focused on learning and the Quadruple Aim outcomes while collecting the IPE core data set and the contribution of contemporary big data science."
de25618a4c05c54f1a779533312fb55d8bfde78c,a human factors engineering education perspective on data science machine learning and automation,"The explosion of data science (DS) in all areas of technology coupled with the rapid growth of machine learning (ML) techniques in the last decade create novel applications in automation. Many working with DS techniques rely on the concept of “black boxes” to explain how ML works, noting that algorithms find patterns in the data that humans might not. While the mathematics are still being developed, the implications for the application of ML, specifically to questions of automation, also are being studied, but still remain poorly understood. The decisions made by ML practitioners with respect to data selection, model training and testing, data visualization, and model applications remain relatively unconstrained and have the potential to yield unexpected results at the systems level. Unfortunately, human factors engineers concerned with automation often have limited training and awareness of DS and ML applications and are unable to provide the meaningful guidance that is needed to ensure the future safety of these newly emerging automated systems. Moreover, undergraduate and graduate programs in human factors engineering (HFE) have not kept pace with these developments and future HFEs may continue to find themselves unable to contribute meaningfully to the development of automated systems based on algorithms derived from ML. In this paper, human factors engineers and educators explore some of the challenges to our understanding of automation posed by specific ML techniques and contrast this with an outline of some of the historical work in HFE that has contributed to our understanding of safe and effective automation. Examples are provided from more conventional applications using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, that are explored with respect to implications for algorithm performance, use in system automation, and the potential for unintended results. Implications for human factors engineering education are discussed."

The project is novel in that it explores a transdisciplinary approach of supporting STEAM education in a school, using data science and an Internet of Things (IoT) based Environment Monitoring System. This case study contributes to an emerging field of research within STEAM that is informed by practice with emphasis placed on the value of collaboration and transdisciplinary pedagogical approaches. The multi collaborators included lecturers from a college of education with expertise in STEM and Visual Arts education, creative professionals (artists, scientists, and architects), teachers, students, and children. Encompassing all the mentioned stakeholders was important and placed transdisciplinarity at the core of the learning. Qualitative data was collected using questionnaires, focus groups and interviews to research how the participants interpreted their experiences and what meaning they attributed to their experiences. It was found that a program of STEAM education integrating new and emerging technologies with data science and the IoT can promote and encourage the delivery of a transdisciplinary model of STEAM education and the overall reconceptualization of how individual subject areas are taught at elementary level. Innovative data capturing technologies, exploring real-life data within their local educational contexts can positively impact children and teachers’ knowledge and skills in STEAM supporting the development of artistic concepts, engineering habits of mind, imagination, and creativity. The success of the project can be attributed to the collaboration between various stakeholders in the design and implementation of the project. This paper has provided valuable insights into teachers’, scientists’, and artists’ perspectives, children’s experiences, and the role of innovative technology in STEAM education."

While many teaching resources exist for data analysis, such resources are not as abundant for data collection given the inherent difficulty of the task. Our proposed exercise centers around student use of Google Calendar to collect data with the goal of answering the question “How do I spend my time?” On the one hand, the exercise involves answering a question with near universal appeal, but on the other hand, the data collection mechanism is not beyond the reach of a typical undergraduate student. A further benefit of the exercise is that it provides an opportunity for discussions on ethical questions and considerations that data providers and data analysts face in today’s age of large-scale internet-based data collection."

With the rapidly evolving job market, an interdisciplinary education can prepare students for the flexibility and broad knowledge base required to adapt. At the University of Pisa, we recognized the value of an interdisciplinary educational environment during our participation in the European project EINFOSE, where we harmonized the entry requirements for master programs in Information Science. Prior to this project, we had been building study programs in Digital Humanities and Data Science, whose intersection organically nurtured a diverse learning space. Through this lens, we will reflect on the obstacles constituted by disciplinary barriers and stress the importance of a flexible and open ‘ecosystem’ for education. These conclusions will be supported by data analysis on the careers of our students over the last eight years."

They can be powerful instruments to monitor, measure, and improve both students learning and teaching process. In the Data Science era, educational technology has an important role collecting, storing and organizing data, allowing instructors to assess a large amount of students even remotely. Thus, once assessment is of central importance to education it is desired that these instruments are reliable and valid. OBJECTIVES: This work aims to describe the potential of validation tools united to educational technology and Rasch Analysis to improve assessments quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three different virtual environments were used to collect data to this study: 3DClass, The Cell and ARMET, mobile applications able to track students’ performance answering quizzes. First, learning objectives were defined for each software purpose. Then, questions were created to assess students learning throughout quizzes. These questions were peerreviewed by experts and then applied to students. After that, the data were refined and analyzed using Rasch Model. DISCUSSION AND RESULTS: Results show that software used in this study provided detailed and organized data regarding students’ behavior, in large scale. From this data, the Rasch model identified overall reliability of the quizzes applied, pointing questions in need of reformulation, consequently identifying students’ abilities that were not estimated precisely. Moreover, we analyzed the assessments level of difficulty in relation to students sample in order to develop new questions that match them. From this data, instructors were able to reformulate the assessments to match course objectives and provide feedback to students in real time. CONCLUSION: This methodology allowed us to refine quizzes in every application to students, establishing criteria to choose which questions we would keep or remove from quizzes, improving their quality in terms of learning objectives and questions reliability."

Vast amounts of data are collected everywhere and disrupting how we design systems and products. Data science and emerging technologies offer challenges and opportunities for early-career human factors professionals who are looking to grow their careers and their human factors practice. In this paper, we report on a survey to assess the perspectives of students currently studying human factors. The survey items examined shortfalls in current human factors education with re-spect to relevance to industry trends. The survey results show that students see a need to include more relevant subjects in data science, as well as opportunities to learn trending industry problems, hands-on experience with real-life projects, prior to graduation."

Higher education institutions aim to equip new generations of students with skills and expertise relevant to workforce participation for decades to come, but their offerings sometimes misalign with commercial needs and new techniques forged at the frontiers of research. Here, we analyze and visualize the dynamic skill (mis-)alignment between academic push, industry pull, and educational offerings, paying special attention to the rapidly emerging areas of data science and data engineering (DS/DE). The visualizations and computational models presented here can help key decision makers understand the evolving structure of skills so that they can craft educational programs that serve workforce needs. Our study uses millions of publications, course syllabi, and job advertisements published between 2010 and 2016. We show how courses mediate between research and jobs. We also discover responsiveness in the academic, educational, and industrial system in how skill demands from industry are as likely to drive skill attention in research as the converse. Finally, we reveal the increasing importance of uniquely human skills, such as communication, negotiation, and persuasion. These skills are currently underexamined in research and undersupplied through education for the labor market. In an increasingly data-driven economy, the demand for “soft” social skills, like teamwork and communication, increase with greater demand for “hard” technical skills and tools."

Theory and practice have been evolving rapidly, and Data Scientist is currently a position much in demand in the job market. All this creates vast research opportunities, as well as the necessity to better understand how to prepare people as researchers and professionals having the background and skills to keep active in a difficult to anticipate future. While there are courses on Data and Information Visualization described in the literature, as well as recommendations by the SIGGRAPH Education Committee, they do not concern Data Science Programs and thus may not be entirely adequate to this type of Program. Besides the general concepts and methods usually addressed, a Visualization course tailored for this particular audience should probably emphasize specific techniques, tools, and examples of using Visualization in several phases along the Data Science process; moreover, it is reasonable to expect that new approaches, useful in practice, will be proposed by the Visualization research community that should be addressed in such a course. Likewise, the bibliography and teaching methods could probably be adapted. We have analyzed over forty MSc Data Science programs offered in English worldwide, and the Visualization courses most of them include, and we argue that there is a need to adapt existing recommendations and create guidelines for these courses. This panel intends to debate this topic and identify issues that need further reflection. ."

As a result, the learning experience is not only dull, but students are quarantined from the authentic research experience of problem solving with data. 
 
Responding to the seminal Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) recommendations (Carver et al., 2016; Franklin et al., 2007), our new data science curriculum allows thousands of students to experience the messy but exhilarating process of independent data discovery from day one. 
 
Through the introduction of an integrated series of collaborative group data-projects, students experience genuine data science research within a scaffolded environment that supports their learning experience. Moving through different data types (sourced data, survey data, client data), students choose their own adventure by constructing their own research questions and then presenting their unique findings to their tutor and peers for interrogation. The use of reproducible RMarkdown documents enables collaboration and the production of professional reports, consistent with any research environment. Though challenging, students report their research experience as satisfying and motivating for their statistics study, as well as transferring to other domains.

In public health, the need for data science skills including data literacy is particularly prominent given both the potential of novel data types and analysis methods to fill gaps in existing public health research and intervention practices, as well as the potential of such data or methods to perpetuate or augment health disparities. Through a review of public health courses and programs at the top 10 U.S. and globally ranked schools of public health, this article summarizes existing educational efforts in public health data science. These existing practices serve to inform efforts for broadening such curricula to further schools and populations. Data science ethics course offerings are also examined in context of assessing how population health principles can be blended into training across levels of data involvement to augment the traditional core of public health curricula. Parallel findings from domestic and international ‘outside the classroom’ training programs are also synthesized to advance approaches for increasing diversity in public health data science. Based on these program reviews and their synthesis, a four-point formula is distilled for furthering public health data science education efforts, toward development of a critical and inclusive mass of practitioners with fluency to leverage data to advance goals of public health and improve quality of life in the digital age."

This emergence also extends to undergraduate education, whereby a growing number of institutions now offer degree programs in data science. However, there is considerable variation in what the field actually entails and, by extension, differences in how undergraduate programs prepare students for data-intensive careers. We used two seminal frameworks for data science education to evaluate undergraduate data science programs at a subset of 4-year institutions in the United States; developing and applying a rubric, we assessed how well each program met the guidelines of each of the frameworks. Most programs scored high in statistics and computer science and low in domain-specific education, ethics, and areas of communication. Moreover, the academic unit administering the degree program significantly influenced the course-load distribution of computer science and statistics/mathematics courses. We conclude that current data science undergraduate programs provide solid grounding in computational and statistical approaches, yet may not deliver sufficient context in terms of domain knowledge and ethical considerations necessary for appropriate data science applications. Additional refinement of the expectations for undergraduate data science education is warranted."

Will the use of nonstandardized methods in data processing with traditional software and hardware lead to data fragmentation and analyses that are nonreproducible? Will healthcare systems incorporate and use big data especially from new publically and patient-generated sources? How will physicians and researchers learn from new open-sourced data and big-data analytics? And ultimately, How can they acquire the skills to create a knowledge translation in data sciences?5

Despite rapidly increasing demand for graduates with experience in the application of analytics, which is relevant to many disciplines, higher education, especially at the undergraduate level, has been slow to react. The academic and policy communities have engaged in a decade-long conversation about the need for—and more effective means of—boosting the number of students graduating with degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). However, this broader transformation will require many more college graduates, including those with non-STEM degrees, to be proficient in the application of analytics in their field, which provides an opportunity to take a fresh look at the skills of liberal arts graduates and the value of liberal arts degrees."

New data science tools applied to data created by government agencies have the potential to enhance these meaningful decisions. However, certain institutional barriers limit the realization of this potential. First, we need to provide systematic training of government employees in data analytics. Second we need a careful rethinking of the rules and technical systems that protect data in order to expand access to linked individual-level data across agencies and jurisdictions, while maintaining privacy. Here, we describe a program that has been run for the last three years by the University of Maryland, New York University, and the University of Chicago, with partners such as Ohio State University, Indiana University/Purdue University, Indianapolis, and the University of Missouri. The program—which trains government employees on how to perform applied data analysis with confidential individual-level data generated through administrative processes, and extensive project-focused work—provides both online and onsite training components. Training takes place in a secure environment. The aim is to help agencies tackle important policy problems by using modern computational and data analysis methods and tools. We have found that this program accelerates the technical and analytical development of public sector employees. As such, it demonstrates the potential value of working with individual-level data across agency and jurisdictional lines. We plan to build on this initial success by creating a larger community of academic institutions, government agencies, and foundations that can work together to increase the capacity of governments to make more efficient and effective decisions.Keywords: training programs, evidence-based policy, confidential data, administrative data research facility, government data"

These rules are intended to support instructors who seek to encourage ethical conduct in (throughout) the practice of science, whether it involves statistics, data science, or qualitative analysis; as well as throughout the employment of tools, methods, and techniques from these domains. Truly integrated ethical training can also promote awareness of the fact that every member of a research – or practice - team has a specific role, with attendant obligations and priorities, relating to the use of statistics, data science, and qualitative analytic approaches. Even if individuals are not going to be the ‘designated statistician/analyst’ on a project, understanding the roles and responsibilities of team members can strengthen the sense of responsibility and accountability of each member of a science or practice team. True integration of ethical training is not simple to achieve, but the ten rules are based on educational and cognitive sciences, as well as a recognition of the fact that additional content, without furthering a course’s existing learning objectives, greatly dampens enthusiasm for, and the likelihood of, integration of ethical training into quantitative courses. Assumptions for readers of these ten simple rules are: the instructor wants to have something that can be graded/evaluated after the students engage with the case; and that one objective the reader has is to teach how to reason & make decisions ethically as students go about practicing or using statistics. The overarching message of the ten rules is that true integration can benefit from leveraging existing structural features that both streamline learning outcomes and increase the chance of successfully embedding ethical practice standards into existing courses. Success is defined as the creation of reproducible, gradable work from students that signal whether or not the ethics instruction had its intended effects; and the documentation of ongoing (sustained) engagement with the ethics training beyond the end of the course."

It has been, and continues to be, an exciting time. But there are systemic challenges faced by these initiatives in the context of the higher education system. Some, but not all, of these challenges center around funding. Campuses fortunate enough to receive initial funding, often as a result of philanthropy or private sector investment, have some measure of sustainability, especially if these funds are in the form of an endowment. However, at most smaller colleges and universities, or those without a lucrative alumnus or local industry investor, just getting started with very limited funding can be daunting. And yet, every school is facing the reality that to truly prepare their student body for the expectations of 21st century employers, they must find a way to incorporate core critical thinking and data-intensive skills into nearly every discipline. This call to action challenges traditional disciplinary silos and begs for new models of higher education. As data science initiatives attempt to breakdown old barriers, they each face a unique set of challenges due to their campus’ political, financial, and structural environments. Our consideration of these challenges and those we have faced directly ourselves lead us to recognize a set of global commonalities. We capture them here in the familiar Ten Simple Rules (TSR) format for simplicity, recognizing much more could be said."

Without easy access to data science training resources, biomedical researchers may find themselves unable to wrangle their own datasets. In 2014, to address the challenges posed such a data onslaught, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative. To this end, the BD2K Training Coordinating Center (TCC; bigdatau.org) was funded to facilitate both in-person and online learning, and open up the concepts of data science to the widest possible audience. Here, we describe the activities of the BD2K TCC and its focus on the construction of the Educational Resource Discovery Index (ERuDIte), which identifies, collects, describes, and organizes online data science materials from BD2K awardees, open online courses, and videos from scientific lectures and tutorials. ERuDIte now indexes over 9,500 resources. Given the richness of online training materials and the constant evolution of biomedical data science, computational methods applying information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques are required - in effect, using data science to inform training in data science. In so doing, the TCC seeks to democratize novel insights and discoveries brought forth via large-scale data science training."

As a first step, based our study, we identified six task decomposition best practices. However, these best practices do not fully address this gap of how to enable data science students to effectively use task modularity. We note that while computer science/information system programs typically teach modularity (e.g., the decomposition process and abstraction), and there remains a need identify a corresponding model to that used for computer science / information system students, to teach modularity to data science students."
dd5b0d5e7f52edb4a1c6f53f18bdda8bc13ea5df,determining the effectiveness of a massive open online course in data science for health,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are widely used to deliver specialized education and training in different fields. Determining the effectiveness of these courses is an integral part of delivering comprehensive, high-quality learning. This study is an evaluation of a MOOC offered by Imperial College London in collaboration with Health iQ called, Data Science Essentials: Real World Evidence. The paper analyzes the reported learning outcomes, attitudes and behaviours of students after completing the MOOC. The study used mixed-methods, drawing from a Kirkpatrick evaluation-using data from semi-structured interviews transcribed and analyzed through Braun and Clark's method for thematic coding. 191 learners joined the MOOC. Two participants who completed at least 75% of the course were interviewed for the course evaluation. The findings of the analysis suggest that the course attracted target learners and learners found its application and engagement methods effective. Learners found the training provided by the MOOC to be helpful and with the potential to be applied in their work environment in the future and identified some work-related barriers that prevent knowledge application. Networking during and post-MOOC was identified as an area that needs improvement and development in the future. Findings derived from this evaluation support the fact that generally, MOOCs can improve learning and knowledge attainment in practical skills-based knowledge. One implication of this study is to inform factors that engage learners in the design and implementation of MOOC. The findings have shown that factors that affect the learners’ engagement are the availability of lecture videos, self-assessment tools and high networking and communication between learners. In terms of knowledge application, support and availability of the right resources are essential because learners are not able to apply learning in their workplace if the workplace lacked the right resources and support. Developers of MOOCs for continuing professional development should take into consideration work-related barriers when designing their MOOCs."

Abstract Classroom teachers are often provided with instructional resources and assessment systems that dictate one pathway for every student's learning and evaluation. These practices remain common despite new affordances available through data-rich, emerging digital technologies that draw on data science and learning science foundations to complement and enhance traditional instruction. This paper presents a conceptual framework for Navigated Learning, a pedagogical approach that operationalizes learning principles using emerging ideas in artificial intelligence and data science, resulting in the continuous, realtime generation of students' cognitive and noncognitive data to support a teacher's ability to utilize the system to customize instruction. The paper articulates the learning principles underlying the pedagogical approach and the features afforded by the Learning Navigator system. The paper concludes with two cases of very different implementation of Navigated Learning focused on fifth grade and ninth grade students' learning of mathematics."
de69d1fe49511ba54c51a65618354ea00a831365,an ischool approach to data science humancentered socially responsible and contextdriven,"The Information Schools, also referred to as iSchools, have a unique approach to data science with three distinct components: human‐centeredness, socially responsible, and rooted in context. In this position paper, we highlight and expand on these components and show how they are integrated in various research and educational activities related to data science that are being carried out at iSchools. We argue that the iSchool way of doing data science is not only highly relevant to the current times, but also crucial in solving problems of tomorrow. Specifically, we accentuate the issues of developing insights and solutions that are not only data‐driven, but also incorporate human values, including transparency, privacy, ethics, fairness, and equity. This approach to data science has meaningful implications on how we educate the students and train the next generation of scholars and policymakers. Here, we provide some of those design decisions, rooted in evidence‐based research, along with our perspective on how data science is currently situated and how it should be advanced in iSchools."
dc64f87a1af4325c3112f2a5a1714c5015257de1,data science literacy toward a philosophy of accessible and adaptable data science skill development in public administration programs,"Public administration is struggling to contend with a substantial shift in practice fueled by the accelerating adoption of information technology. New skills, competencies and pedagogies are required by the field to help overcome the data-skills gap. As a means to address these deficiencies, we introduce the Data Science Literacy Framework, a heuristic for incorporating data science principles into public administration programs. The framework suggests that data literacy is the dominant principle underlying a shift in professional practice, accentuated by an understanding of computational science, statistical methodology, and data-adjacent domain knowledge. A combination of new and existing skills meshed into public administration curriculums help implement these principles and advance public administration education."

The research process is divided into two stages: 1) context analysis and 2) development and assessment. The data is analyzed by means of standardized deviations statistically. The research findings suggested that the SPPS-DSA architecture, according to the research findings, consists of three key components: i) data source, ii) machine learning methods and attributes, and iii) data science process. The SPPS-DSA architecture is rated as the highest appropriate overall. Predicting student performance helps educators and students improve their teaching and learning processes. Predicting student performance using various analytical methods is reviewed here. Most researchers used CGPA and internal assessment as data sets. In terms of prediction methods, classification is widely used in educational data science. Researchers most commonly used neural networks and decision trees to predict student performance under classification techniques."

As such, there is growing interest in designing initiatives to help young people learn about data—not only the techno-mathematical skills necessary to work with data, but also the dispositions needed to participate in data-centric ways of knowing and doing. In this article, we argue that as this educational goal is pursued, it is important to attend to the normative scripts that are often associated with data, and how they relate to learners’ perspectives and prior experiences. We do this by examining two initiatives that aimed to help young people learn about data and its “real-world” applications by engaging them in participatory mapping activities, directed toward the study of local community challenges. We argue that when there are mismatches between students’ realities and how reality is described to work in data science, making the time and space to examine these contradictions can lead to a robust engagement with data science and its applications. These findings have implications for how we might better design tools and learning activities that connect data science with the broader contexts that frame young people’s lives."

Addressing this need in academic education and the challenge of interdisciplinary teamwork in the biomedical domain, the authors have designed and implemented a new Master's program for biomedical data science that accepts students with different educational backgrounds, medical doctors, veterinarians and students with a Bachelor's degree in life sciences, and incorporates blended learning. This paper aims to present the didactic concept of the program, report on feedback from the students and first evaluation results, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this approach. Our results show that the program is well-accepted by the students, who stress the benefits of working in interprofessional teams, the option for part-time study along with their jobs with flexible learning opportunities, and of good and intensive interaction offers with their peers and teachers. Readjustments are necessary to improve tutoring support and alignment of content among distinct modules and to decrease workload peaks. While our evaluation results are still preliminary, we are convinced that our approach of mostly online offers, yet with a strong focus on teamwork, practical exercises guided by experts and communication skills, may serve to educate students to be well-prepared for their future tasks and operations in biomedical data science, in research, clinical care and industry."

It is targeted towards and attended by working professionals involved or interested in data collection and data analysis including those working in official statistics. The program conveys competencies in the areas of data collection, data analysis, data storage, and data visualization. The faculty of the program includes researchers and lecturers from both the University of Maryland and the University of Mannheim as well as other organizations such as destatis and Statistics Netherlands in the field of official statistics. The program was awarded the label of ‘European Master in Official Statistics (EMOS)’ under conditions in May 2021. In the article, we summarize the methodological and statistical competencies needed in official statistics and show how IPSDS covers this set of skills. We will present the flipped classroom design used for the IPSDS program and demonstrate that it is especially suited for students who are working professionals at the same time."

97da06c34e2289b1310a262c752832ddfe416d07,when data science becomes software engineering,"Data science is strongly related to knowledge discovery. It can be said that the output of the data science work is input to the knowledge discovery process. With data science evolving as a discipline of its own, it is estimated that the U.S.A alone, needs more than 1M professionals skilled in the discipline by next year. If we include the needs of the rest of the world, then internationally, it needs more than that. Consequently, private and public educational institutions are hurriedly offering data science courses to candidates. The general emphasis of these courses understandably, is in the use of data mining and machine learning tools and methods. In this paper, we will argue that the subject of software engineering should also be taught to these candidates formally, and not haphazardly, as if it is something the would-be data scientist can pick up along the way. In this paper, we will examine the data science work process and the present state of skills training provided by data science educators. We will present warrants and arguments that software engineering as a discipline can not be taken for granted in the training of a data scientist."

Universities need to provide data science students with a plethora of learning opportunities that involve collaboration in interdisciplinary contexts and engagement with industry partners. Curtin University and Lab Tests Online Australasia (LTOAU) collaborated to provide an interdisciplinary, industry‐focused learning experience for data science students. Upon completing the project, students reported improved understanding of the range of applications for data science skills. The experience delivered opportunities for greater self‐awareness and highlighted the importance of teamwork, decision‐making and leadership skills. This chapter presents Interdisciplinary Project‐based Work‐Integrated Learning (IPjWIL), an educational approach that equips data science students with the necessary skills to navigate the future world of work. The results of the pilot project described demonstrate how interdisciplinary, industry‐focused learning experiences enhance the capabilities of data science students, thereby augmenting employability."
a3f96f98ec99fe48b19fe74933f9a2e2018105ca,waking up to marginalization public value failures in artificial intelligence and data science,"Data science education is increasingly becoming an integral part of many educational structures, both informal and formal. Much of the attention has been on the application of AI principles and techniques, especially machine learning, natural language processing and predictive analytics. While AI is only one phase in the data science ecosystem, we must embrace a fuller range of job roles that help manage AI algorithms and systems — from the AI innovators and architects (in CS, Math and Statistics) to the AI technicians and specialists (in CS, IT and IS). Also, it’s important that we better understand the current state of the low participation and representation of minoritized groups that further stifles the accessibility and inclusion efforts. However, how we learn and what we learn is highly dependent on who we are as learners. In this paper, we examine demographic disparities by race/ethnicity and gender within the information systems educational infrastructure from an evaluative perspective. More specifically, we adopt intersectional methods and apply the theory of public value failure to identify learning gaps in the fast-growing field of data science. National datasets of Master’s and Doctoral graduate students in IS, CS, Math and Statistics are used to create an “institutional parity score” which calculates field-specific representation by race/ethnicity and gender in data science related fields. We conclude by showcasing bias creep including the situational exclusion of individuals from access to the broader information economy, be it access to technologies and data or access to participate in the data workforce or data enabled-economic activity. Policy recommendations are suggested to curb and reduce this marginalization within in-formation systems and related disciplines."

This panel focuses on the opportunities and challenges this poses for the Information Systems (IS) community. Specifically, the panel focuses on three key questions at the nexus of data science, skills, and IS: a) characterizing the changes in skill demand from industry in a variety of international contexts, b) evaluating the role of IS departments in educating the next generation of these workers, and c) identifying how IS research should adjust to complement new educational initiatives. These questions are provocative because they are rooted in a debate about whether industry investment in modern data technologies requires new workers and skills, new courses and faculty, and a new knowledge base, or whether data science is best understood as a rebranded phenomenon that will be rapidly and effectively absorbed into existing infrastructure."

Attendees at the ASIS&T Research Data Access and Preservation (RDAP) Summit, held in March 2012, discussed education and training for data managers and considered data literacy as a critical skill comparable to information and digital literacy. George Mason University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University in collaboration with the Cornell University Library are leading the way in programs offering degrees and certificates on data science research and education. Most educational materials are available online. There was agreement on the need for expanding the numbers of skilled data management practitioners and addressing data manager training in grants for heavily data-driven projects, though the balance between theory and practice prompted diverging opinions."
74de92aa4f74a305ba7ab965fe4fd9ba1bdfde76,towards openworld scenarios teaching the social side of data science,"This article reflects on current challenges we encounter in teaching data science to graduate students. A common critique of data science classes is that examples are static and student group work is embedded in an ‘artificial’ and ‘academic’ context. We look at how we can make teaching data science classes more relevant to real-world problems. Student engagement with real problems—and not just ‘real-world data sets’—has the potential to stimulate learning, exchange, and serendipity on all sides, and on different levels: noticing unexpected things in the data, developing surprising skills, finding new ways to communicate, and, lastly, in the development of new strategies for teaching, learning and practice."
09322829c7cab5fe4f2d3853c631501b87e63276,enriching undergraduate mathematics curriculum with computer science courses,"Traditional mathematics curriculum faces several issues nowadays. The gap between course materials and students’ real-life mathematical experiences, the scattering of knowledge in different courses, and the lack of mathematics applications to other subjects all hinder the learning of students. The emerg-ing trends in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence also impel higher education to enrich and refine mathematics education. In order to better incubate students for future, the experience of enriching undergrad-uate mathematics curriculum with computer science courses is introduced in this study. The curriculum is designed and implemented for students who major in applied mathematics to better stimulate the learning, participation, exercise, and innovation. It provides students with comprehensive theoretical and practical knowledge for the challenges and industrial requirements now-adays. Evaluations, major findings, and lessons learned from three refined courses are discussed for more insight into the following deployment and re-finement of the curriculum."
99b0c306bc51fc161ea24cfe07d1f4d28be916ca,the promise of portfolios training modern data scientists,"Data scientists rely on many technical skills and the ability to reason about data to solve problems. As educators grapple with how to prepare students in this new field, they are faced with identifying both what a student must know and what a student should be able to do by the end of their data science education, and also how to collect evidence of those abilities. We present a way to unite and coordinate individual efforts toward training well-rounded data scientists: a data science portfolio that highlights strong communication. This structuring of classroom assignments provides a way to evaluate students' mastery of material in each class and also allows for a student to build a professional portfolio that remains valuable after the class is over.Data science portfolio pieces broadly include written and visual assignments that give students practice crafting data-driven arguments and narratives for a variety of audiences. This flexible nature of the portfolio gives students a way to demonstrate their abilities in an inclusive, ‘choose your own adventure’ way.As students refine and share their portfolios with others throughout a course or program, they can see their own growth and receive feedback from instructors, peers, and the broader data science community.We provide examples of and guidance for how to implement a data science portfolio approach in single courses and wider data science programs."

It looks back into the 1990s and looks forward to new challenges for such tools stemming from an updated conception of statistical literacy and challenges from big data, the exploding use of data in society and the emergence of data science. A focus is on Fathom, TinkerPlots and Codap, which are looked at from the perspective of requirements for tools for statistics education. Experiences and success conditions for using these tools in various educational contexts are reported, namely in primary and secondary education and preservice and in-service teacher education. New challenges from data science require new tools for education with new features. The paper finishes with some ideas and experience from a recent project on data science education at the upper secondary level"

Analysis: An architectural framework has been devised for educational data mining. The ultimate motive is to extensively investigate the techniques like classification, regression and recommender systems in predicting the student performance and to explore the prediction accuracy of these techniques as well. For this purpose very many researches that have successfully implemented these techniques were carefully studied and their contribution to predicting the performance were analysed. Findings and Novelty: It came to light that ensembles created by combining classifiers performed well and their accuracy in predicting the performance was commendable compared to the individual performance of the classification, regression and recommender techniques. The nuance of this study is the incorporation of recommender systems along with conventional techniques since these are not commonly used in performance prediction. Tensor factorization in particular has desirable effect in prediction since it takes the time factor into consideration. It is a fact that performance of students increases over time."

Collecting and interpreting data is a key component of every interaction between physicians and patients. Data can be anything from blood pressure measurements at a yearly exam to complex radiology images interpreted by experts or algorithms. Interpreting these uncertain data for accurate diagnosis, management, and care is a critical component of every physician’s daily life. The intimate relationship between data science and medicine is apparent in the pages of our most prominent medical journals. Using Pubmed, we pulled the abstracts of all papers published in The New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, Nature Medicine, The Lancet, PLoS Medicine, and BMJ for the years 2010 - March 2019. We then searched for a list of statistical terms in the text of these abstracts. For these 12,281 abstracts a median of 50% (IQR 30%, 67%) of sentences contained a term that would require statistical training to understand."

The impact from the trend of technology-mediated translation prompted the ratification of technology literacy as a major competence for modern translators. Consequently, teaching of translation technology including but not limited to Computer-aided Translation (CAT) and Machine Translation (MT) became part of comprehensive curricula for translation training programs. However, in many institutions, the teaching of translation technology was haunted by issues such as: narrow scope of curriculum design, outdated technologies, and unbalance between theories and practices in teaching. The study was the pilot evaluation of a tailored course to foster translation trainees’ knowledge and abilities of data science. The course was designed to be a fundamental step toward sophisticated translation technologies. During the pilot evaluation of the 8-week course, 85 students (n = 85) were recruited as participants. The study adopted a mix-method design by employing a survey to investigate student’s level of satisfaction toward the course and focus group discussion to understand students’ attitudes and perceptions of key aspects of the course. By interpreting the results from statistical analysis of the survey (5.39/7) and thematic analysis of the focus group discussion, the course of data science for translators was well received among participants. The evaluation project manifested the feasibility and effectiveness of a translator-oriented data science course."

The traditional face-to-face, the blended approach that combines the strengths of face-to-face with the application of technologies, and the online approach, which is the form of learning that takes place over the Internet. This article reports on the impact of the forced transformation of a data science course, previously provided through a blended approach, into a fully online course, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The impact is reported in terms of the effort required by the teacher, the students’ feedback and the didactic outcomes. The students’ feedback and the didactic outcomes were compared with the students of the 2018/2019 academic year and between students directly involved or not in the management of the outbreak. The results show an increase in the perceived didactic quality, in the engagement and in the didactic outcomes (only the latter not statistically significant). Also, a specific tool used for the blended approach was very much appreciated by the students and we collected useful feedback for its improvement. The paper ends by summarising the main results, also discussed with colleagues, in order to consider our results alongside other experiences."

Data scientists need to be equipped with skills to tackle the complexities of the societal context surrounding their data science work. In this paper, we offer insights into how to structure our data science classes so that they motivate students to deeply engage with material about societal context and lean into the types of conversations that will produce long-lasting growth in critical thinking skills. In particular, we describe a novel assessment tool called participation portfolios, which is motivated by a framework that promotes student autonomy, self reflection, and the building of a learning community. We compare students’ participation before and after implementing this assessment tool, and our results suggest that this tool increased student participation and helped them move towards course learning objectives."

In particular, big data in genetics, neuroimaging, mobile health, and other subfields of biomedical science, promises new insights, but also poses challenges. To address these challenges, the National Institutes of Health launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, including a Training Coordinating Center (TCC) tasked with developing a resource for personalized data science training for biomedical researchers. The BD2K TCC web portal is powered by ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index, which collects training resources for data science, including online courses, videos of tutorials and research talks, textbooks, and other web-based materials. While the availability of so many potential learning resources is exciting, they are highly heterogeneous in quality, difficulty, format, and topic, making the field intimidating to enter and difficult to navigate. Moreover, data science is rapidly evolving, so there is a constant influx of new materials and concepts. We leverage data science techniques to build ERuDIte itself, using data extraction, data integration, machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing to automatically collect, integrate, describe, and organize existing online resources for learning data science."
ff090ce765ac5cd9d655e034167530ae5b8488d6,beyond ethics considerations for centering equityminded data science,"In this paper, we utilize duoethnography — a research method in which practitioners discursively interrogate the relationships between culture, context, and the mechanisms which shape individual autobiographical experiences — to explore what may be beyond ethics in the context of data science. Although ethical frameworks have the ability to reflect cultural priorities, a singular view of ethics, as we explore, often fails to speak to the multiple and diverse priorities held both within and across institutional spaces. To that end, this paper explores multiple perspectives, epistemologies, and worldviews that can collectively push researchers towards considerations of a data science education that is equityminded both in concept and practice. Through a set of dialogues which examine our positionalities, journeys, ethics, local cultures, and accountabilities, this paper explores the contextual realities rooted in the authors’ educational settings. These conversations focus on the humanity of our students, the communities from which we come from and serve, as well as the unintentional harms and possibilities associated with the development of data science programs across institutional types. We take a set of five core questions to examine how we made, and continue to make, sense of our diverse cultural perspectives on data science education and equity with/in relation to others’ realities. Broadly, this paper seeks to offer reflections on the related but differing functions of ethics and equity in data science education."

To realize the potential of big data in biomedicine, the National Institutes of Health launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, funding several centers of excellence in biomedical data analysis and a Training Coordinating Center (TCC) tasked with facilitating online and inperson training of biomedical researchers in data science. A major initiative of the BD2K TCC is to automatically identify, describe, and organize data science training resources available on the Web and provide personalized training paths for users. In this paper, we describe the construction of ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index for Data Science, and its release as linked data. ERuDIte contains over 11,000 training resources including courses, video tutorials, conference talks, and other materials. The metadata for these resources is described uniformly using Schema.org. We use machine learning techniques to tag each resource with concepts from the Data Science Education Ontology, which we developed to further describe resource content. Finally, we map references to people and organizations in learning resources to entities in DBpedia, DBLP, and ORCID, embedding our collection in the web of linked data. We hope that ERuDIte will provide a framework to foster open linked educational resources on the Web."

The objective of this quantitative research is to analyze the teachers’ perceptions about the impact of Moodle in the educational field considering data science and machine learning. The independent variable is the use of Moodle during the organization of new school activities and the dependent variables are the performance of the activities inside and outside the classroom and the participation and communication during the educational process. The participants are 70 teachers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The results of machine learning (linear regression) indicate that Moodle positively influences the participation and communication during the educational process. Likewise, this LMS positively influences the performance of the activities inside and outside the classroom. In particular, Moodle allows improving the educational field through the realization of the online exams and discussion forums, diffusion of the tasks and consultation of the contents at any time. Data science identifies 3 predictive models on the impact of Moodle in the educational field. In fact, the decision tree technique establishes the conditions on the use of this LMS considering the characteristics of the teachers (sex and maximum degree of study). The implications of this research allow affirming that teachers have the opportunity to create, organize and carry out various creative and active activities through this LMS. Finally, teachers can use Moodle to update the activities of the courses and build new educational spaces that allow the active role of the students during the learning process."

They are often associated with economic and social factors suggested to contribute to good school performance, however there is no consensus on the impact of these factors. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the factors related to school performance. Using a data set composed by Brazilian schools’ performance (IDEB), socioeconomic and school structure variables, we generated different models. The non-linear model predicted the best performance, measured by the error and determination coefficient metrics. The heterogeneity of the importance of the variable between school cycles and regions of the country was detected, this effect may contribute to the development of public educational policies."

The technical tools and techniques emphasized by hydroinformatics and water data science involve distinctive instructional styles, which may be facilitated by online formats and materials. In the broader hydrologic sciences, there has been a simultaneous push for instructors to develop, share, and reuse content and instructional modules, particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a wide scale pivot to online instruction. The experiences of hydroinformatics and water data science instructors in the effectiveness of content formats, instructional tools and techniques, and key topics can inform educational practice not only for those subjects, but for water science generally. This paper reports the results of surveys and interviews with hydroinformatics and water data science instructors. We address the effectiveness of instructional tools, impacts of the pandemic on education, important hydroinformatics topics, and challenges and gaps in hydroinformatics education. Guided by lessons learned from the surveys and interviews and a review of existing online learning platforms, we developed four educational modules designed to address shared topics of interest and to demonstrate the effectiveness of available tools to help overcome identified challenges. The modules are community resources that can be incorporated into courses and modified to address specific class and institutional needs or different geographic locations. Our experience with module implementation can inform development of online educational resources, which will advance and enhance instruction for hydroinformatics and broader hydrologic sciences for which students increasingly need informatics experience and technical skills."
5a29ba6dfd524dc0e69cbd7ebe009c59eed0c571,school inequalities and urban welfare going beyond socioeconomic status with data science,"The fast-changing Brazilian urban reality segregates people in socio-spatial terms and distributes urban public resources unfairly, threatening student’s access to the structure of educational opportunities and causing school inequalities. Factors such as the existence of public lighting, open sewage and garbage accumulated around the homes, as well as electricity and water supply, sanitation, and the number of residents per bathroom, are discussed as predictors of school achievements as measured using their average IDEB (Basic Education Development Index) outcomes using Data Science methods. It was found that the resident/bathroom density and the household wall material indicators in a municipality have a higher correlation with its average school achievements than the average students’ socioeconomic status, relations that are clearly illustrated through bivariate choropleth maps across all the 5,388 Brazilian municipalities with available valid data. These results are compatible with research that reveals the presence of a “neighbourhood effect,” such that the distributional inequalities in infrastructure access and ultimately the notion of urban welfare reduces educational opportunities and engenders social inequalities, what is incompatible with the ideal of a sustainable society."
e84b0421db5e4e80e199332af61e38350b26ee0b,augmenting teachers with data science powers joining human and artificial intelligence to assist students,"Technology has the potential to influence the processes and outcomes of teaching and learning. Researchers notice a high demand for online education, but these environments generate educational data in high quantity, diversity and velocity, which requires the use of technology. However, putting too much emphasis on artificial intelligence is not bringing the expected results. It is time to position teachers as the principal decision-makers in the “classroom” and use AI as an assistant. Our proposal is a tool (called T-Partner) to help online teachers: (1) search for relevant patterns in the educational data; (2) created visualisations to present the results in a more teacher-friendly way; (3) recommend study plans, based on students’ needs. For that, we applied data science techniques on these data and processed the results, making it easier for teachers to understand them. We evaluated the tool, asking participants to use it to complete some tasks that simulate a teacher analysing data to make pedagogical decisions. We evaluated time, correctness, number of doubts and the participants’ perceptions. The results show that most participants were able to complete the tasks in an appropriate amount of time and considered the T-Partner useful and easy to use in an online learning context."

e72de4edc98353fefb585c9ee223a893e17c1120,an educators perspective of the tidyverse,"Computing makes up a large and growing component of data science and statistics courses. Many of those courses, especially when taught by faculty who are statisticians by training, teach R as the programming language. A number of instructors have opted to build much of their teaching around use of the tidyverse . The tidyverse, in the words of its developers, “is a collection of R packages that share a high-level † design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next” (Wickham et al. 2019). These shared principles have led to the widespread adoption of the tidyverse ecosystem. A large part of this usage is because the tidyverse tools have been intentionally designed to ease the learning process and make it easier for users to learn new functions as they engage with additional pieces of the larger ecosystem. Moreover, the functionality oﬀered by the packages within the tidyverse spans the entire data science cycle, which includes data import, visualisation, wrangling, modeling, and communication. We believe the tidyverse provides an eﬀective and eﬃcient pathway for undergraduate students at all levels and majors to gain computational skills and thinking needed throughout the data science cycle. In this paper, we introduce the tidyverse from an educator’s perspective. We provide a brief introduction to the tidyverse, demonstrate how foundational statistics and data science tasks are accomplished with the tidyverse, and discuss the strengths of the tidyverse, particularly in the context of teaching and learning."

14cc711b06f6ee2f69c8cd703c922cb4e380c1e0,teachers perception of jupyter and r shiny as digital tools for open education and science,"During the last ten years advances in open-source digital technology, used especially by data science, led to very accessible ways how to obtain, store, process, analyze or share data in almost every human activity. Data science tools bring not only transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility in open science, but also give benefits in open education as learning tools for improving effectiveness of instruction. Together with our pedagogical introduction and review of Jupyter as an interactive multimedia learning tool we present our three-years long research in the framework of a complex mixed-methods approach which examines physics teachers’ perception of Jupyter technology in three groups: Ph.D. candidates in physics education research (PER) (N = 9), pre-service physics teachers (N = 33) and in-service physics teachers (N = 40). Despite the fact that open-source Jupyter notebooks are natural and easy as email or web, the results suggest that in-service teachers are not prepared for Jupyter technology and open analysis, but positively accept open education data presented via another open-source data science tool, R Shiny interactive web application, as an important form of immediate feedback and learning about the quality of their instruction. Simultaneously our instruction results in the frame of the Flipped Learning also indicate that young beginning PER researchers and pre-service physics teachers can master key digital skills to work with Jupyter technology appreciating its big impact on their learning, data and statistical literacy or professional development. All results support the ongoing worldwide effort to implement Jupyter in traditional education as a promising free open-source interactive learning tool to foster learning process, especially for the upcoming young generation."

This mixed research aims to analyse students’ perceptions about the use of the collaborative wall in the teaching-learning process for physics, considering data science. The collaborative wall is a web application that allows the participation of the students in the classroom through the dissemination of text and images. The participants are 77 students of the National Preparatory School No. 7 ‘Ezequiel A. Chávez’ who took the course of Physics IV during the 2019 school year. At home, these students searched for and consulted information about the physics of hearing in order to create their infographics collaboratively using the Piktochart software. During the face-to-face sessions, the teacher of the course of Physics IV requested the creation of teams (maximum six members) to carry out the collaborative activities and used the projector to show the collaborative wall. Subsequently, each team uploaded their infographics on the collaborative wall through mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones to initiate the discussion of the Physics of Hearing topics. The results of machine learning (linear regression) indicate that the dissemination of infographics on the collaborative wall positively influences participation in the classroom, students’ motivation, and the learning process about the physics of hearing. Data science identifies three predictive models about using the collaborative wall in physics through the decision tree technique. Finally, the collaborative wall facilitates the active role of the students during the face-to-face sessions, communication in the classroom and realisation of the collaborative activities."
cde2a4c1e9d2d1b60ebaab548a41b4a78c5491c3,would you rather have it be accurate or diverse how male middleschool students make sense of algorithm bias,"As data-driven decisions become more ubiquitous, it will be critical for youth to understand the impacts of algorithm bias. In this study, we discuss the design of an extracurricular data science program and examined how the participants (12 males, ages 11 13) made sense of algorithm bias and discrimination. We conducted a critical discourse analysis on one classroom discussion. Results suggest that participants showed initial understandings that algorithms contain biases that may perpetuate discrimination. Introduction and theory Big data algorithms are becoming increasingly relevant in social and policy decisions and can now be used to decide whether people secure employment, receive loans, or are convicted of a crime. Unfortunately, such algorithms reinforce racial and gender discrimination at large scales and are largely unintelligible to the public (Noble, 2018; O’Neil, 2016). As these big data-driven decisions become more ubiquitous, it will be critical for young people to understand computational statistics and the ethical consequences of algorithm bias. Recent studies have examined big data practices for middle-school students (Jiang & Kahn, 2019) and the intersections of data visualizations and spatial justice (Rubel et al., 2017). However, few have investigated how young people engage discursively with big data algorithm bias and racial/gender discrimination. In this study, we designed a data science extra-curricular course for middle school students. The research question is How do male middle-school students engage in algorithm bias and discrimination topics in a data science curriculum? Philip and colleagues (2013) have proposed a framework on big data for democratic participation that is rooted in both sociocultural and critical pedagogy theories. Using these two perspectives, Philip and colleagues proposed three categories of student objectives for democratic data science: content proficiency and discursive fluency (the ability to use language and tools of the discipline), motivated use of content (learners see themselves as users of data science and work towards greater justice and equity in society), and the politics of knowledge (learners know that data is political and address limitations/opportunities for particular populations). These three categories purposefully center topics of inequities, power, and ethics around big data algorithms."

LA-CoNGA physics (for Latin-American alliance for Capacity buildiNG in Advance physics) is an ERASMUS+ project aiming to support the modernization of university infrastructure and its pedagogical offer in advanced physics in four Latin-American countries: Colombia, Ecuador, Perú and Venezuela. This project is co-funded by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency of the European Commission. This virtual teaching and research network comprises three partner universities in Europe and eight in Latin-America; high-level scientific partners (CEA, CERN, CNRS, DESY, ICTP), and several and two industrial partners. Open Science education and Open Data are the heart of our operations. In practice, LA-CoNGA physics has created a set of graduate courses in Advanced Physics (high energy physics and complex systems) that are common to all institutions, supported by the installation of interconnected remote laboratories and on an open e-learning platform. This program, incorporated into the master’s programs of jesus.pena@correo.uis.edu.co 1 ar X iv :2 20 1. 02 25 6v 1 [ ph ys ic s. ed -p h] 6 J an 2 02 2 the eight Latinamerican partners, is based on three pillars: high energy physics/Complex System courses, data science, and instrumentation. During 2019 we prepared the syllabuses and selected the lecturers. In 2020 the strict lock-downs modified our pedagogical strategies. The planned model –an eight-node network of universities made-up by local groups for discussions– was transformed into low-quality home participation. We simplified the connectivity requirements to the minimum bandwidth that could operate remote labs. We also changed the lecture interaction and evaluation model, balancing the teamwork on course projects and continuous evaluation based on class exercises. Despite the lockdown scenario, we managed to support the needs of our instrumentation and computing courses thanks to the contribution and enthusiasm of our partners. With the support of 30 instructors, we gave 100 lectures to 67 students in the four countries. We are now promoting the second cohort due to start in January 2022. 1 Virtual research and learning community A virtual research community is a distributed group of researchers working together with large shared instruments through a virtual environment. These scientific environments –based on high-speed networks, distributed computing, video-conferencing and remote instrument operations– are commonly referred to as e-Infrastructures. The European Commission has invested heavily in promoting this type of collaboration among scientists worldwide, funding many international projects to create shared e-Infrastructures around the globe [1, 2]. The Latin-American communities of Astrophysics and high energy physicist were pioneers in establishing Virtual Research and Learning Networks, creating productive international consortia in virtual research environments and training the new generation of scientists [3]. The emerging generation of scientists is trained in this collaborative and distributed open science environment under the virtual research and learning community (VRLC) paradigm [4]. Employing video-conferencing tools, VRLC develops face-toface relationships to ensure teacher immediacy and student social presence to facilitate collaborative engagement. Virtual research and learning networks offer accessibility when institutions/groups might not have all the resources/staff locally. Sharing distributed resources provide a collaborative environment that frees educational resources, connectivity, acquisition of digital skills, and foster implementations/development of new learning methods/strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed many of these practices in the academy. We learned that we could manage much of these teaching activities. We became convinced that ideas can flow without being driven by mobility and physical attendance at congresses and/or scientific meetings. We gradually realised that many of these learnings are here to stay. When"

The paper describes the use of data from different sources (a Virtual Learning Environment, survey, and academic system) to generate predictive models and discover the most impactful variables linked to student success. The combination of different data sources demonstrated a high predictive power, achieving prediction rates with outstanding discrimination at the fourth week of a course. The analysis showed that students with more interactions inside the Virtual Learning Environment tended to have more success in their disciplines. The results also revealed some relevant attributes that influenced the students’ success, such as the number of subjects the student was enrolled in, the students’ mother’s education, and the students’ neighborhood. From the results emerged some institutional policies, such as the allocation of computational resources for the Virtual Learning Environment infrastructure and its widespread use, the development of tools for following the trajectory of students, and the detection of students at-risk of failure. The construction of an interdisciplinary exchange bridge between sociology, education, and data science is also a significant contribution to the academic community that may help in constructing university educational policies."

GitHub Classroom aims to provide a way for students to work on and submit their assignments via Git and GitHub, giving teachers an opportunity to facilitate the integration of these version control tools into their undergraduate statistics courses. In the Fall 2017 semester, we implemented GitHub Classroom in two educational settings—an introductory computational statistics lab and a more advanced computational statistics course. We found many educational benefits of implementing GitHub Classroom, such as easily providing coding feedback during assignments and making students more confident in their ability to collaborate and use version control tools for future data science work. To encourage and ease the transition into using GitHub Classroom, we provide free and publicly available resources—both for students to begin using Git/GitHub and for teachers to use GitHub Classroom for their own courses."

In this paper, we propose a third dimension to reproducibility practices and recommend that regardless of whether they teach reproducibility in their courses or not, data science instructors adopt reproducible workﬂows for their own teaching. We consider computational reproducibility, documentation, and openness as three pillars of reproducible teaching framework. We share tools, examples, and recommendations for the three pillars."
1aecc5be666f93f3d8ad6e2df261c770adfc5e7b,privacy preserving synthetic health data,"We examine the feasibility of using synthetic medical data generated by GANs in the classroom, to teach data science in health infor-matics. We present an end-to-end methodology to retain instructional utility, while preserving privacy to a level, which meets regulatory requirements: (1) a GAN is trained by a certified medical-data security-aware agent, inside a secure environment; (2) the final GAN model is used outside of the secure environment by external users (instructors or researchers) to generate synthetic data. This second step facilitates data handling for external users, by avoiding de-identification, which may require special user training, be costly, and/or cause loss of data fidelity. We benchmark our proposed GAN versus various baseline methods using a novel set of metrics. At equal levels of privacy and utility, GANs provide small footprint models, meeting the desired specifications of our application domain. Data, code, and a challenge that we organized for educational purposes are available."

Many of the skills and practices of data science—working collaboratively with a team, organizing raw data, dealing with non-traditional data types, sorting through datasets with hundreds of variables—are hard to teach in a classroom setting. Assigning projects is one approach, but in our experience, many student projects were far below the level we hoped that students would achieve. DataFest, which now includes participants from fifteen U.S. colleges and universities, provides an opportunity for students to challenge themselves with realistic, large data sets in an intense, fun, and encouraging environment."

The setting also can be applied to shorter and longer classes as well as introductory and advanced courses. I propose a project-based seminar that also encompasses elements of an inverted classroom. As a result of this combination, the seminar supports students’ learning progress and also creates engaging virtual classes. To demonstrate how to apply a project-based seminar setting to teaching statistics and programming classes, I use an introductory class to data wrangling and management with the statistical software program R. Students are guided through a typical data science workflow that requires data management and data wrangling and concludes with visualizing and presenting first research results during a simulated mini-conference."

In this article, I argue that it is time for a reshaping by offering my personal view of the past, present and future of our field. Educational research—and research in the social and life sciences—is at a crossroads. There are many reasons for this, but chief among them is the rapid rise of data science, which has implications for educational research in general and SREE in particular. I ask us to question whether our laser focus on causal inference—which will remain crucially important—has crowded out other methods for studying equally important—yet not necessarily causal—questions. After introducing the wisdom of four muses—two philosophers of science and two statisticians—I sketch my personal research trajectory and its intersection with the field’s. The remainder of the article describes three types of studies that I would like to see more of: longitudinal studies using truly longitudinal analyses; assessment and measurement studies; and studies using data science methods."

19148ab5e64f742cbfc1d9f056730adba93b03d7,the preparation of stewards with the mastery rubric for stewardship reenvisioning the formation of scholars and practitioners,"A steward of the discipline was originally defined as “someone who will creatively generate new knowledge, critically conserve valuable and useful ideas, and responsibly transform those understandings through writing, teaching, and application”. This construct was articulated to support and strengthen doctoral education. The purpose of this paper is to expand the construct of stewardship so that it can be applied to both scholars and non-academic practitioners, and can be initiated earlier than doctoral education. To accomplish and justify this, we describe a general developmental trajectory supporting cross-curriculum teaching for stewardship of a discipline as well as of a profession. We argue that the most important features of stewardship, comprising the public trust for the future of their discipline or profession, are obtainable by all practitioners, and are not limited to those who have completed doctoral training. The developmental trajectory is defined using the Mastery Rubric construct, which requires articulating the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to be targeted with a curriculum; recognizable stages of performance of these KSAs; and performance level descriptors of each KSA at each stage. Concrete KSAs of stewardship that can be taught and practiced throughout the career (professional or scholarly) were derived directly from the original definition. We used the European guild structure’s stages of Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master for the trajectory, and through a consensus-based standard setting exercise, created performance level descriptors featuring development of Bloom’s taxonometric cognitive abilities (see Appendix A) for each KSA. Together, these create the Mastery Rubric for Stewardship (MR-S). The MR-S articulates how stewardly behavior can be cultivated and documented for individuals in any disciplinary curriculum, whether research-intensive (preparing “scholars”) or professional (preparing members of a profession or more generally for the work force). We qualitatively assess the validity of the MR-S by examining its applicability to, and concordance with professional practice standards in three diverse disciplinary examples: (1) History; (2) Statistics and Data Science; and (3) Neurosciences. These domains differ dramatically in terms of content and methodologies, but students in each discipline could either continue on to doctoral training and scholarship, or utilize doctoral or pre-doctoral training in other professions. The MR-S is highly aligned with the practice standards of all three of these domains, suggesting that stewardship can be meaningfully cultivated and utilized by those working in or outside of academia, supporting the initiation of stewardship prior to doctoral training and for all students, not only those who will earn PhDs or be scholars first and foremost. The MR-S can be used for curriculum development or revision in order to purposefully promote stewardship at all levels of higher education and beyond. The MR-S renders features of professional stewardship accessible to all practitioners, enabling formal and informal, as well as self-directed, development and refinement of a professional identity."

Purpose
As data-driven tools increasingly shape our life and tech ethics crises become strikingly frequent, data ethics coursework is urgently needed. The purpose of this study is to map the field of data ethics curricula, tracking relations between courses, instructors, texts and writers, and present a proof-of-concept interactive website for exploring these relations. This method is designed to be used in curricular research and development and provides multiple vantage points on this multidisciplinary field.


Design/methodology/approach
The authors use data science methods to foster insights about the field of data ethics education and literature. The authors present a semantic, linked open data graph in the Resource Description Framework, along with proof-of-concept analyses and an exploratory website. Its framework is open-source and language-agnostic, providing the seed for future contributions of code, syllabi and resources from the global data ethics community.


Findings
This method provides a convenient means of exploring an overview of the field of data ethics’ social and textual relations. For educators designing or refining a course, the authors provide a method for curricular introspection and discovery of transdisciplinary curricula.


Research limitations/implications
The syllabi the authors have collected are self-selected and represent only a subset of the field. Furthermore, this method exclusively represents a course’s assigned literature rather than a holistic view of what courses teach. The authors present a prototype rather than a finished product.


Originality/value
This curricular survey provides a new way of modeling a field of study, using existing ontologies to organize graph data into a comprehensible overview. This framework may be repurposed to map the institutional knowledge structures of other disciplines, as well.

6f48fa9b5c0ad66a35174456e9e0bef91d61dfc3,exploiting the power of information in medical education,"Abstract The explosion of medical information demands a thorough reconsideration of medical education, including what we teach and assess, how we educate, and whom we educate. Physicians of the future will need to be self-aware, self-directed, resource-effective team players who can synthesize and apply summarized information and communicate clearly. Training in metacognition, data science, informatics, and artificial intelligence is needed. Education programs must shift focus from content delivery to providing students explicit scaffolding for future learning, such as the Master Adaptive Learner model. Additionally, educators should leverage informatics to improve the process of education and foster individualized, precision education. Finally, attributes of the successful physician of the future should inform adjustments in recruitment and admissions processes. This paper explores how member schools of the American Medical Association Accelerating Change in Medical Education Consortium adjusted all aspects of educational programming in acknowledgment of the rapid expansion of information."

Thought leaders representing a variety of industries were surveyed regarding their perspectives on the future of pharmacy practice, pharmaceutical science disciplines, and pharmacy education in seven domains. From 46 completed surveys, top challenges/threats were barriers that limit clinical practice opportunities, excessive supply of pharmacists, and high drug costs. Major changes in the drug distribution system, automation/robotics, and new therapeutic approaches were identified as the top technological disrupters. Key drivers of pharmacy education included the primary care provider shortage, growing use of technology and data, and rising drug costs. The most significant sources of job growth outside of retail and hospital settings were managed care organizations, technology/biotech/pharmaceutical companies, and ambulatory care practices. Needs in the industry included clinical management of complex patients, leadership and management, pharmaceutical scientists, and implementation science. Knowledge gaps were pharmacists not recognizing their value on the health care team, preparation to embrace and lead change, and expertise in data science and analytics. Pharmacy schools will need to address several disruptive trends to future-proof their curricula, including expanding patient management skills, leadership and management training, technology, and data analytics."
f2d32791f08ea3eb9fa464241c2a70f452b99bce,training for translation between disciplines a philosophy for life and data sciences curricula,"Motivation Our society has become data‐rich to the extent that research in many areas has become impossible without computational approaches. Educational programmes seem to be lagging behind this development. At the same time, there is a growing need not only for strong data science skills, but foremost for the ability to both translate between tools and methods on the one hand, and application and problems on the other. Results Here we present our experiences with shaping and running a masters' programme in bioinformatics and systems biology in Amsterdam. From this, we have developed a comprehensive philosophy on how translation in training may be achieved in a dynamic and multidisciplinary research area, which is described here. We furthermore describe two requirements that enable translation, which we have found to be crucial: sufficient depth and focus on multidisciplinary topic areas, coupled with a balanced breadth from adjacent disciplines. Finally, we present concrete suggestions on how this may be implemented in practice, which may be relevant for the effectiveness of life science and data science curricula in general, and of particular interest to those who are in the process of setting up such curricula."
3bde4e30bba938eaa1d7a6f9f3624e5c4081269f,the r quest from users to developers,"R is not a programming language, and this produces the inherent dichotomy between analytics and software engineering. With the emergence of data science, the opportunity exists to bridge this gap, especially through teaching practices. Genesis: How did we get here? The article “Software Engineering and R Programming: A Call to Action” summarizes the dichotomy between analytics and software engineering in the R ecosystem, provides examples where this leads to problems and proposes what we as R users can do to bridge the gap. Data Analytic Language The fundamental basis of the dichotomy is inherent in the evolution of S and R: they are not programming languages, but they ended up being mistaken for such. S was designed to be a data analytic language: to turn ideas into software quickly and faithfully, often used in “non-programming” style (Chambers, 1998). Its original goal was to enable the statisticians to apply code which was written in programming languages (at the time mostly FORTRAN) to analyze data quickly and interactively for some suitable definition of “interactive” at the time (Becker, 1994). The success of S and then R can be traced to the ability to perform data analysis by applying existing tools to data in creative ways. A data analysis is a quest at every step we learn more about the data which informs our decision about next steps. Whether it is an exploratory data analysis leveraging graphics or computing statistics or fitting models the final goal is typically not known ahead of time, it is obtained by an iterative process of applying tools that we as analysts think may lead us further (Tukey, 1977). It is important to note that this is exactly the opposite of software engineering where there is a well-defined goal: a specification or desired outcome, which simply needs to be expressed in a way understandable to the computer."

The learning activity focuses on understanding distribution logistics problems related to transportation optimization using different techniques. These optimization challenges include the vehicle routing problem, the arc routing problem, and the team orienteering problem. As a result of the learning process in the virtual lab, it is expected that students acquire competencies and skills related to logistics and transportation challenges as well as problem-solving. These competencies and skills can be precious for students’ future careers, since they increase students’ analytical skills, capacity to understand heuristic-based algorithms, teamwork and interdisciplinary communication skills, programming skills, and statistical abilities. A preliminary version of this training activity has already been used in MSc and PhD courses held at universities in Spain, Italy, Ireland, and Portugal."

The sample is comprised of 72 students in the basic mathematics class during the 2018 school year. The results of the machine learning show that watching audiovisual content before class, doing exercises collaboratively during class using the application GeoGebra, and doing laboratory practices after class using the application GeoGebra have a positive influence on the development of mathematical skills. Data science identifies three predictive models on the use of the flipped classroom and the student profile using the decision tree technique. Finally, the flipped classroom facilitates the creation of new educational spaces via the use of technology and allows creative activities to be organized before, during and after class."

One of the benefits of using R in this context is its ability to visualize the results. Using R to generate visualizations has gained in popularity due to the increased number of R packages available to convert data to graphic display. In this paper, I ask the following question: how can student engagement with protein analysis be promoted using R‐based visualizations in the classroom? During the 2021 IUBMB/ASBMD workshop “Teaching Science with Big Data”, I presented a teaching strategy that used R for the visualization of protein data. In this report, I provide a teaching procedure and a summary of how students engaged with these data in our Introduction to R for Professional Data Science class. This report is based on a case study methodology by reviewing student peer comments for protein analyses conducted in R. The results indicated that students were active participants in the peer‐review process and that they learned to take a critical view of data visualization."

eb7924c2496f32422c548afaae93c32de5f4ea5e,who is wining a comparison of humans versus computers for calibration model building,"Increasing awareness of the ability to transform data into knowledge has steered more focus on data science within the educational system as well as the development of machine learning methods capable of handling complex problems with minimal or no human interaction. In principle, this raises the question on where human–computer interaction is superior in building good models in contrast to fully automated algorithms. In this study, we investigated modeling performance by using bachelor students, master students, and a fully automated procedure on three near‐infrared (NIR) calibration tasks of increasing complexity. From a total of 107 student and +5000 automated models, it is evident that simple calibration tasks can be automated to achieve similar or better performance, whereas for the more complicated tasks, the human–computer interaction is superior. Indeed, teaching data science and chemometrics should focus on tools for fundamental data understanding and emphasize the use of domain knowledge and critical thinking in the analysis of data."

In the present study we conducted a comprehensive assessment of stigma to describe and compare stigma toward mental disorders in students enrolled in five different university degrees. Methods Three hundred and twenty-five students from the University of Valencia (Spain), attending the second term of their first-degree courses in the faculties of medicine, psychology, teaching, economics, and data science participated in this cross-sectional study. Stigma was measured using: the Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS), the Scale of Community Attitudes toward Mental Illness (CAMI), the Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-27), and the Knowledge about Mental Illness test (KMI). Results We found different patterns of stigma according to gender, the fact of knowing or living with a person with mental disorders and the university degree studied. Overall, women show fewer stigmatizing attitudes than men but similar stereotypes and prejudice toward people with mental disorders. However, the pattern of results across degrees is more complex. Overall, students of medicine, psychology and teaching showed fewer stigmatizing attitudes than students of economics and data science but differences between degrees were more subtle in stereotypes and prejudice toward people with mental disorders. Conclusion Our study suggests the existence of different profiles of stigma in relation to mental disorders in university students. These profiles varied in relation with the degree being studied, gender and already knowing or living with a person with mental disorders."
f7e24951880efe83ff8d283db4736b551778d356,a journey from wild to textbook data to reproducibly refresh the wages data from the national longitudinal survey of youth database,"Textbook data is essential for teaching statistics and data science methods because they are clean, allowing the instructor to focus on methodology. Ideally textbook data sets are refreshed regularly, especially when they are subsets taken from an on-going data collection. It is also important to use contemporary data for teaching, to imbue the sense that the methodology is relevant today. This paper describes the trials and tribulations of refreshing a textbook data set on wages, extracted from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) in the early 1990s. The data is useful for teaching modeling and exploratory analysis of longitudinal data. Subsets of NLSY79, including the wages data, can be found in supplementary ﬁles from numerous textbooks and research articles. The NLSY79 database has been continuously updated through to 2018, so new records are available. Here we describe our journey to refresh the wages data, and document the process so that the data can be regularly updated into the future. Our journey was diﬃcult because the steps and decisions taken to get from the raw data to the wages textbook subset have not been clearly articulated. We have been diligent to provide a reproducible workﬂow for others to follow, which also hopefully inspires more attempts at refreshing data for teaching. Three new data sets and the code to produce them are provided in the open source R package called yowie . This paper demonstrates the steps of cleaning data, including subjective decisions made on dealing with anomalies, and documents the process, as recommended by Huebner, Vach, and Cessie (2016). They emphasize that making the data cleaning process accountable and transparent is imperative and essential for the integrity of downstream statistical analyses and model building. Clean data often then goes through an “initial data analysis” (IDA) (Chatﬁeld 1985), where one would summarize and scrutinize the data, especially to check if the data is consistent with assumptions required for modeling. This stage is related to exploratory data analysis (EDA), coined by Tukey (1977) with a focus on learning from data. EDA can be considered to encompass IDA. In practice, the three stages of cleaning, summarizing, and exploring are cyclical, one often needs to do more cleaning after scrutinizing. Dasu and Johnson (2003) say that data cleaning and exploration is a diﬃcult task and typically consumes a large percentage of the time spent in analyzing data. Our approach to cleaning builds heavily on the tidyverse approach (Wickham et al. 2019). The data is ﬁrst organized into “tidy data” (Wickham 2014) and then further wrangled using step-wise piping with a split-apply-combine strategy for mutating new variables (Wickham 2011). Tidy data shouldn’t be confused with “tame data,” which Kim, Ismay, and Chunn (2018) coined to refer to textbook data sets suitable for teaching, particularly teaching statistics. The resulting (tame) data is provided in a new R package called yowie , which includes the code so that the process is reproducible and could be used to further refresh the data as new records are made available in the NLSY79 database. This paper is structured in the following way. Section 2 describes the NLSY79 data source. presents the steps cleaning data, getting and tidying the data the NLSY79 repair anomalies. subset compared"

We propose new approaches for teaching, learning and assessment in face-to-face and blended environments to improve the e-learning experience of our students. In particular, we prepare teaching and learning resources using R Markdown. These resources support self-oriented learning, which would allow us to move to a flipped classroom model. We also develop a specific R package for the course. We use Kahoot and R/exams for summative assessment. The e-assessment is used in conjunction to hands-on exercises to reduce the time taken to mark coursework."

To better develop personalized learning plans for students, it is necessary to build a model that can automatically evaluate students’ performance in online education. For this purpose, in this study we propose an ensemble learning method named light gradient boosting channel attention network (LGBCAN), which is based on label distribution estimation. First, the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) is used to predict the performance in online learning tasks. Then The Channel Attention Network (CAN) model further improves the function of LightGBM by focusing on better results in the K-fold CrossEntropy of LightGBM. The results are converted into predicted classes through post-processing methods named approximation of label distribution to complete the classification task. The experiments are employed on two datasets, data science bowl (DSB) and answer correctness prediction (ACP). The experimental results in both datasets suggest that our model has better robustness and generalization ability."
2dd8afb4f31bcf91c665dbd176c700186a116742,teachers opinion about collaborative virtual walls and massive open online course during the covid pandemic,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mexican universities incorporated technological tools to update the activities of the courses under the distance modality. This quantitative research analyzes the teachers' perception about Collaborative Virtual Walls (CVWs) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) through data science. The participants are 54 professors from the National Autonomous University of Mexico who completed the International Diploma “Innovation in University Teaching 2021”. The results of machine learning indicate that CVWs and MOOCs positively influence the learning and participation of the students. Likewise, the decision tree technique identifies 4 predictive models about these technological tools. This study recommends the incorporation of ICTs in the educational field because teachers can organize and carry out creative activities under the distance modality. Even universities can include in their strategic planning the incorporation of CVWs and MOOCs in the educational process. The limitations of this research are the sample and analysis about the perception of the teachers in a Mexican university. Therefore, future research can analyze CVWs and MOOCs considering the development of skills and satisfaction of the students in the middle schools, high schools and universities. In conclusion, teachers rely on technological advances such as CVWs and MOOCs to create new school activities under the distance modality and improve the teaching-learning conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 by authors;licensee OJCMT."
f4469bd66ffaaf27ff79a2a039dcab59a9d3a80c,decision support model to adopt big data analytics in higher education systems,"Data science or specifically data analytics systems have become an emerging trend in information technology and have attracted many organizations, including higher education. Higher Education Systems (HES) involve very active entities (students, faculty members, researchers, employers) who generate and require large volumes of data that go beyond the structured data stored in the house. The collection, analysis, and visualization of such big data present a huge challenge for HES. Big data analysis could be the solution to this challenge. However, the rationale and decision process for the adoption of big data analytics can be difficult. Such a knowledge-driven process requires a multitude of technical and organizational aspects that must be accounted for to ensure informed decisions are made. Existing research and development indicates that the decision to adopt, although systematic research with a theoretical background is rare and none of the existing studies have considered diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory. This paper aims to support HES, by providing a systematic analysis of the determinants for the decision to adopt big data analytics. An integrated framework referred to as the Technology Organization Environment (TOE) framework is proposed. The proposed framework is validated using structural equation modeling. Eleven determinants are confirmed that influence the TOE-driven framework for data analytics in HES. The result is expected to contribute to on-going research that attempts to address the complex and multidimensional challenge that relates to data science and analytics implementation in HES."

However, there is still a growing need for bioscientists, from different backgrounds, with different levels, to acquire programming skills, which could reduce the time from data to insights and bridge communication between life scientists and computer scientists. Python is a programming language extensively used in bioinformatics and data science, which is particularly suitable for beginners. Here, we describe the conception, organization, and implementation of the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data. This workshop has been organized by graduate and undergraduate students and supported, mostly in administrative matters, by experienced faculty members since 2017. The workshop was conceived for teaching bioscientists, mainly students in Brazil, on how to program in a biological context. The goal of this article was to share our experience with the 2020 edition of the workshop in its virtual format due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to compare and contrast this year’s experience with the previous in-person editions. We described a hands-on and live coding workshop model for teaching introductory Python programming. We also highlighted the adaptations made from in-person to online format in 2020, the participants’ assessment of learning progression, and general workshop management. Lastly, we provided a summary and reflections from our personal experiences from the workshops of the last 4 years. Our takeaways included the benefits of the learning from learners’ feedback (LLF) that allowed us to improve the workshop in real time, in the short, and likely in the long term. We concluded that the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data is a highly effective workshop model for teaching a programming language that allows bioscientists to go beyond an initial exploration of programming skills for data analysis in the medium to long term."

c27f3bf6901b5df801c63bf5117a6fd05b6fd2e4,reflection on modern methods sharedparameter models for longitudinal studies with missing data,"Abstract A primary goal of longitudinal studies is to examine trends over time. Reported results from these studies often depend on strong, unverifiable assumptions about the missing data. Whereas the risk of substantial bias from missing data is widely known, analyses exploring missing-data influences are commonly done either ad hoc or not at all. This article outlines one of the three primary recognized approaches for examining missing-data effects that could be more widely used, i.e. the shared-parameter model (SPM), and explains its purpose, use, limitations and extensions. We additionally provide synthetic data and reproducible research code for running SPMs in SAS, Stata and R programming languages to facilitate their use in practice and for teaching purposes in epidemiology, biostatistics, data science and related fields. Our goals are to increase understanding and use of these methods by providing introductions to the concepts and access to helpful tools."

It applied a data science approach to learning and teaching data gathered from the learning management system used at this university. Data were collected and analysed from 23 subjects, spanning over 5500 student enrolments and 406 lecturer and tutor roles, over a five-year period. Based on a theoretical framework adapted from Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework by Garrison et al. (2000), the data were segregated into three groups for analysis: Student Engagement, Course Content and Teacher Input. The data analysis revealed a positive correlation between Student Engagement and Teacher Input, and interestingly, a negative correlation between Student Engagement and Course Content when a certain threshold was exceeded. The findings of the study offer useful suggestions for future course design, and pedagogical approaches teachers can adopt to foster student engagement."
8070a0a2a1c655bf0f647852dde9c6a26744bf90,personalized recommendation model of highquality education resources for college students based on data mining,"With the rapid development of information technology and data science, as well as the innovative concept of “Internet+” education, personalized e-learning has received widespread attention in school education and family education. The development of education informatization has led to a rapid increase in the number of online learning users and an explosion in the number of learning resources, which makes learners face the dilemma of “information overload” and “learning lost” in the learning process. In the personalized learning resource recommendation system, the most critical thing is the construction of the learner model. Currently, most learner models generally have a lack of scientific focus that they have a single method of obtaining dimensions, feature attributes, and low computational complexity. These problems may lead to disagreement between the learner’s learning ability and the difficulty of the recommended learning resources and may lead to the cognitive overload or disorientation of learners in the learning process. The purpose of this paper is to construct a learner model to support the above problems and to strongly support individual learning resources recommendation by learning the resource model which effectively reduces the problem of cold start and sparsity in the recommended process. In this paper, we analyze the behavioral data of learners in the learning process and extract three features of learner’s cognitive ability, knowledge level, and preference for learning of learner model analysis. Among them, the preference model of the learner is constructed using the ontology, and the semantic relation between the knowledge is better understood, and the interest of the student learning is discovered."

Here I review achievements of the book and highlight complementary paths not taken, including discussion of recent computational techniques like transformers, which have come to dominate automated language understanding and are just beginning to find their way into the careful research designs showcased in the book. These new methods not only highlight text as a signal from society, but textual models as simulations of society, which could fuel future advances in causal inference and experimentation. Text as Data's focus on textual discovery, measurement and inference points us toward this new frontier, cautioning us not to ignore, but build upon social scientific interpretation and theory."
3d2bd2e0335ec794571f1bccea3027cae120639e,predicting hcv incidence in latinos with highrisk substance use a data science approach,"ABSTRACT Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the U.S. has tripled in the prior five years, and injecting drug use is the primary risk for HCV, with up to 90% of older and former people who inject drugs (PWIDs) testing positive. Laboratory testing of HCV for any PWIDs is the gold standard, however many PWIDs lack access to health treatment or services. Identifying risks of HCV via a data science approach would aid community health workers (CHW) to rapidly link those most at risk of infection with treatment. This study employed a data-science approach to determine the strongest risk factors of HCV in a sample of Mexican-Americans WIDs n = 221 (96 negative/125 positive). Data included 238 demographic and psychosocial predictors. A Random Forest machine learning algorithm demonstrated significant prediction improvement over baseline no information rate comparison. Strongest risks for positive HCV included sharing drug-use equipment and younger age at first heroin use; receiving drug-education during incarceration was protective. A ROC curve fit to the prediction yielded an area under the curve of 0.77. Predictive variables of HCV in the present analysis can be obtained via screening by CHW. Identification of patients most at risk of HCV within community settings can maximize treatment utilization."
d18408072b81cad0b399a8dc6d1cc1e1e1b2a642,changes in academic libraries in the era of open science,"In this paper we study the changes in academic library services inspired by the Open Science movement and especially the changes prompted from Open Data as a founding part of Open Science. We argue that academic libraries face the even bigger challenges for accommodating and providing support for Open Big Data composed from existing raw data sets and new massive sets generated from data driven research. Ensuring the veracity of Open Big Data is a complex problem dominated by data science. For academic libraries, that challenge triggers not only the expansion of traditional library services, but also leads to adoption of a set of new roles and responsibilities. That includes, but is not limited to development of the supporting models for Research Data Management, providing Data Management Plan assistance, expanding the qualifications of library personnel toward data science literacy, integration of the library services into research and educational process by taking part in research grants and many others. We outline several approaches taken by some academic libraries and by libraries at the City University of New York (CUNY) to meet necessities imposed by doing research and education with Open Big Data – from changes in libraries’ administrative structure, changes in personnel qualifications and duties, leading the interdisciplinary advisory groups, to active collaboration in principal projects."

It is straightforward to involve computers and virtual laboratory tools into engineering education. This study presents the development of an interactive virtual laboratory method for a continuous binary distillation process. The three main steps, namely, mathematical modeling, model calibration, and graphical user interface (GUI) development are described and discussed in this paper. The model takes into account the specific needs of the simulator (fast run time) and limitations from the measurement system (calibration considerations). Then, it is validated based on temperature and concentration data from a lab/pilot scale continuous rectification column. The separation of an ethanol–water mixture is considered, the classroom example of distillation, which is, on the other hand, an azeotrope‐forming nonideal mixture. The objective of this paper, beyond the virtual laboratory coding description, is to provide useful guidelines for a user‐friendly and yet realistic simulator development for commonly available experimental devices in chemical engineering education. To fulfill this aim, MATLAB and LabVIEW, two routinely used programming languages by chemical and process engineers, are used."

The historical arguments have been reflected in the near past as Mendel’s concept has been diversified by new types of omics data. As an effect of the accumulation of omics data, a virtual gene concept forms, giving rise to genetical data science. The concept integrates genetical, functional, and molecular features of the Mendelian paradigm. I argue that the virtual gene concept should be deployed pragmatically. Indeed, the concept has already inspired a practical research program related to systems genetics. The program includes questions about functionality of structural and categorical gene variants, about regulation of gene expression, and about roles of epigenetic modifications. The methodology of the program includes bioinformatics, machine learning, and deep learning. Education, funding, careers, standards, benchmarks, and tools to monitor research progress should be provided to support the research program."
70493f14d9dfceb0b6b67fd6d2c0e9b2df2de21d,multiple correspondence analysis of factors influencing student acceptance of massive open online courses,"There have been manifold thrilling studies strikingly conducted in recent years to explore factors influencing student acceptance of massive open online courses (MOOCs). The principal goal was to determine future prediction and sustainable use of MOOCs for providing pervasive quality education services. This has led to the examination of different theoretical models tested on varying sample sizes for factor exploration. However, existing studies have reflected heterogeneous results caused by divergent sources not observed in the literature using the multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). This study aimed to apply the data science method of MCA to explore hidden associations amongst factors influencing student acceptance of MOOCs and heterogeneity sources of theoretical models and sample sizes to blur the literature hiatus. Results based on data extracted from 54 primary studies published from 2015 to 2021 with a total of 19,638 valid student responses generally conclude the existence of four main levels of associations. The four associations were respectively composed of single, blended, extended and complex theories and each level is associated with distinct categories and a combination cloud of similar categories. Moreover, results indicated that very small sample size is the most unusual under the basic assumption that none of the variables are correlated. It is practically germane to confirm hidden associations in a dataset of influencing factors to help reach a much greater understanding of the application and performance of MOOCs for sustainable education services."
6c2bb70d3f9c7bc98645c6084eec11efd034e093,teaching principal components using correlations,"ABSTRACT Introducing principal components (PCs) to students is difficult. First, the matrix algebra and mathematical maximization lemmas are daunting, especially for students in the social and behavioral sciences. Second, the standard motivation involving variance maximization subject to unit length constraint does not directly connect to the “variance explained” interpretation. Third, the unit length and uncorrelatedness constraints of the standard motivation do not allow re-scaling or oblique rotations, which are common in practice. Instead, we propose to motivate the subject in terms of optimizing (weighted) average proportions of variance explained in the original variables; this approach may be more intuitive, and hence easier to understand because it links directly to the familiar “R-squared” statistic. It also removes the need for unit length and uncorrelatedness constraints, provides a direct interpretation of “variance explained,” and provides a direct answer to the question of whether to use covariance-based or correlation-based PCs. Furthermore, the presentation can be made without matrix algebra or optimization proofs. Modern tools from data science, including heat maps and text mining, provide further help in the interpretation and application of PCs; examples are given. Together, these techniques may be used to revise currently used methods for teaching and learning PCs in the behavioral sciences."

The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model was used for semantic relatedness computation to enable an understanding of the mechanisms and processes through which humans encode and retrieve lexical units. To test the similarity of the output of the topic model and human word association, the “Time-limited Multiple Divergent Thinking Test of Word Associative Strategy” (TLM-DTTWAS) was used to collect data and conduct tests with three food-related stimulus words. A total of 101 subjects took the tests, producing 4,251 words. The empirical results were analyzed on two levels: (1) by the expert word association classification: taxonomic and script proposed by Ross and Murphy (1999); (2) followed by the associative hierarchy theory of Mednick (1962), to sort the vocabulary test results into two associative hierarchies, “steep” and “flat.” The analysis indicated that human word association displays randomness, as well as generalization and continuity. After the experimental text was passed through the LDA latent semantic model which demonstrated highly significant correlation. This was a whole new attempt to train a data science model to make inference and prediction of human concept association which could be very useful in teaching as well as commercial applications."
12e07589cec1d83ac671f408fe90adc38292b0d3,how academic health systems can be ready for the next pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic created significant challenges for academic health systems (AHSs) across their tripartite mission of providing clinical care, conducting research, and educating learners. Despite these challenges, AHSs played an invaluable role in responding to the pandemic. Clinicians worked tirelessly to care for patients, and institutions quickly reoriented their care delivery systems. Furthermore, AHSs played an important role in advancing science, launching studies and clinical trials to examine new vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. However, there is room for improvement; AHSs can use lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic to reshape their operations for the future. To prepare for the next pandemic, AHSs must modernize, adapt, and transform their clinical operations, research infrastructure, and educational programs to include public health and to build surveillance capacity for detecting, monitoring, and managing emerging outbreaks. In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe the opportunities AHSs have to build on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ways they can take advantage of their unique strengths in each of their 3 mission areas. Within clinical care, AHSs can reach patients outside traditional clinical settings, build national and regional networks, advance data-driven insights, engage with the community, and support and protect the workforce. Within research, they can leverage data science and artificial intelligence, perform pandemic forecasting, leverage the social and behavioral sciences, conduct clinical trials, and build a research and development preparedness and operational plan. Within education, AHSs can promote remote learning, make interprofessional learning the norm, and build a system of continuing education."
4f39aa0047396a55c85d1d98b2c43353e649abec,designing reinforcement learning algorithms for digital interventions preimplementation guidelines,"Online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are increasingly used to personalize digital interventions in the fields of mobile health and online education. Common challenges in designing and testing an RL algorithm in these settings include ensuring the RL algorithm can learn and run stably under real-time constraints, and accounting for the complexity of the environment, e.g., a lack of accurate mechanistic models for the user dynamics. To guide how one can tackle these challenges, we extend the PCS (predictability, computability, stability) framework, a data science framework that incorporates best practices from machine learning and statistics in supervised learning to the design of RL algorithms for the digital interventions setting. Furthermore, we provide guidelines on how to design simulation environments, a crucial tool for evaluating RL candidate algorithms using the PCS framework. We show how we used the PCS framework to design an RL algorithm for Oralytics, a mobile health study aiming to improve users’ tooth-brushing behaviors through the personalized delivery of intervention messages. Oralytics will go into the field in late 2022."

Public repositories – most prominently GitHub – make them available. The number of notebooks is growing almost exponentially as more and more software developers, data scientists and machine learning students, teachers and engineers share their notebooks publicly. They use these repositories not only to store own notebooks but to find solutions to their specific problems at hand. The open exchange of computational narratives in Jupyter notebooks is an overwhelming success story. In this paper we ask the question of how does the use and spread of publicly available notebooks affect the quality of code and its embedding in a computational narrative. Drawing on empirical studies and our own experiences in the creation of digital material to support machine learning education and our observation of students’ use of notebooks we comment on the quality. Our findings include that we cannot just reuse the concrete quality criteria that are in use for software in general. Much rather we must integrate the competing demands in creating a linear computational narrative, thus adapting programming style and design patterns to the data science context."
d7bca609c63129bd96798f7584f512cc52444dc6,a mathematics pipeline to student success in data analytics through coursebased undergraduate research,"This paper reports on Data Analytics Research (DAR), a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in which undergraduate students conduct data analysis research on open real-world problems for industry, university, and community clients. We describe how DAR, offered by the Mathematical Sciences Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), is an essential part of an early low-barrier pipeline into data analytics studies and careers for diverse students. Students first take a foundational course, typically Introduction to Data Mathematics, that teaches linear algebra, data analytics, and R programming simultaneously using a project-based learning (PBL) approach. Then in DAR, students work in teams on open applied data analytics research problems provided by the clients. We describe the DAR organization which is inspired in part by agile software development practices. Students meet for coaching sessions with instructors multiple times a week and present to clients frequently. In a fully remote format during the pandemic, the students continued to be highly successful and engaged in COVID-19 research producing significant results as indicated by deployed online applications, refereed papers, and conference presentations. Formal evaluation shows that the pipeline of the single on-ramp course followed by DAR addressing real-world problems with societal benefits is highly effective at developing students' data analytics skills, advancing creative problem solvers who can work both independently and in teams, and attracting students to further studies and careers in data science."
6da6a2fea9fb96db717e321d0e068b5dbfa764f6,interdisciplinary and transferable concepts in bioinformatics education observations and approaches from a uk msc course,"Bioinformatics is a highly interdisciplinary subject, with substantial and growing influence in health, environmental science and society, and is utilised by scientists from many diverse academic backgrounds. Education in bioinformatics therefore necessitates effective development of skills in interdisciplinary collaboration, communication, ethics, and critical analysis of research, in addition to practical and technical skills. Insights from bioinformatics training can additionally inform developing education in the tightly aligned and emerging disciplines of data science and artificial intelligence. Here, we describe the design, implementation, and review of a module in a UK MSc-level bioinformatics programme attempting to address these goals for diverse student cohorts. Reflecting the philosophy of the field and programme, the module content was designed either as “diversity-addressing”—working toward a common foundation of knowledge—or “diversity-exploiting”—where different student viewpoints and skills were harnessed to facilitate student research projects “greater than the sum of their parts.” For a universal introduction to technical concepts, we combined a mixed lecture/immediate computational practical approach, facilitated by virtual machines, creating an efficient technical learning environment praised in student feedback for building confidence among cohorts with diverse backgrounds. Interdisciplinary group research projects where diverse students worked on real research questions were supervised in tandem with interactive contact time covering transferable skills in collaboration and communication in diverse teams, research presentation, and ethics. Multi-faceted feedback and assessment provided a constructive alignment with real peer-reviewed bioinformatics research. We believe that the inclusion of these transferable, interdisciplinary, and critical concepts in a bioinformatics course can help produce rounded, experienced graduates, ready for the real world and with many future options in science and society. In addition, we hope to provide some ideas and resources to facilitate such inclusion."

Young citizens appear to be vulnerable in the face of poor quality news or those containing nonexplicit ideologies. In the field of data science, computational and statistical techniques have been developed to automatically collect and characterize online news media in real time. Nevertheless, there is still not a lot of interdisciplinary research on how to design data exploration platforms supporting an educational process of critical citizenship. This article explores this opportunity through a case study analyzing critical thinking ability of students when facing news dealing with the social mobilization “No+APF”. From data collected through 4 online exercises conducted by 75 secondary school students, 55 university students and 25 communication specialists, we investigate to what extent young citizens are able to classify news headlines and ideological orientation of news media outlets. We also question the influence of the media’s brand name and the subjectivity of each participant in regards to the social mobilization “No+APF”. The results underline the importance of group work, the influence of the brand name and the correlation between criticalthinking abilities and having a defined opinion."
d0855a20e92831e40adf4859967569e878cf49fd,interpretation of artificial intelligence studies for the ophthalmologist,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in ophthalmology has increased dramatically. However, interpretation of these studies can be a daunting prospect for the ophthalmologist without a background in computer or data science. This review aims to share some practical considerations for interpretation of AI studies in ophthalmology.


RECENT FINDINGS
It can be easy to get lost in the technical details of studies involving AI. Nevertheless, it is important for clinicians to remember that the fundamental questions in interpreting these studies remain unchanged - What does this study show, and how does this affect my patients? Being guided by familiar principles like study purpose, impact, validity, and generalizability, these studies become more accessible to the ophthalmologist. Although it may not be necessary for nondomain experts to understand the exact AI technical details, we explain some broad concepts in relation to AI technical architecture and dataset management.


SUMMARY
The expansion of AI into healthcare and ophthalmology is here to stay. AI systems have made the transition from bench to bedside, and are already being applied to patient care. In this context, 'AI education' is crucial for ophthalmologists to be confident in interpretation and translation of new developments in this field to their own clinical practice."

Topic and trend mapping is a mature field with hundreds of publications on approaches, methods and tools for data collection, analysis, feature extraction and reduction, clustering and visualisation tools and algorithms. Our study aims to map the evolution of topics published by the journal Education for Information. Interdisciplinary Journal on Information Studies (EFI henceforth) which has been in existence since 1983, in order to understand how this journal has evolved and how it is positioned with regard to the field of Library and Information Science to which it belongs. Our study is part of the body of work on topic detection and text mining. Our results showed that the journal displayed a remarkable stability in its editorial policy over more than three decades. With the arrival of its third Editor in Chief in 2018, a shift towards more technologically oriented topics and to specialties from other fields are perceptible such as health information, data science and digital humanities."

Consequently, the professional roles of data scientists and data analysts are in high demand in the labor market. Although the technical competencies expected for these roles are well known, their behavioral competencies have not been thoroughly investigated. Drawing on the competency-based theoretical framework, this study aims to address this gap, providing evidence of the emotional, social and cognitive competencies that data scientists and data analysts most frequently demonstrate when they effectively perform their jobs, and identifying those competencies that distinguish them.Design/methodology/approachThis study is exploratory in nature and adopts the competency-based methodology through the analysis of in-depth behavioral event interviews collected from a sample of 24 Italian data scientists and data analysts.FindingsThe findings empirically enrich the extant literature on the intangible dimensions of human capital that are relevant in analytics roles. Specifically, the results show that, in comparison to data analysts, data scientists more frequently use certain competencies related to self-awareness, teamwork, networking, flexibility, system thinking and lateral thinking.Research limitations/implicationsThe study was conducted in a small sample and in a specific geographical area, and this may reduce the analytic generalizability of the findings.Practical implicationsThe skills shortages that characterize these roles need to be addressed in a way that also considers the intangible dimensions of human capital. Educational institutions can design better curricula for entry-level data scientists and analysts who encompass the development of behavioral competencies. Organizations can effectively orient the recruitment and the training processes toward the most relevant competencies for those analytics roles.Originality/valueThis exploratory study advances our understanding of the competencies required by professionals who mostly contribute to the performance of data science teams. This article proposes a competency framework that can be adopted to assess a broader portfolio of the behaviors of big data professionals."

These activities are more noticeable in Engineering, in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, etc. Additionally, these activities acquire even more relevance with a distance education methodology, as our case is. The inclusion of these practical activities has clear advantages, such as (1) promoting critical thinking and (2) improving students’ abilities and skills for their professional careers. There are several options, such as the use of remote and virtual laboratories, virtual reality and game-based platforms, among others. This work addresses the development of a new cloud game-based educational platform, which defines a modular and flexible architecture (using light containers). This architecture provides interactive and monitoring services and data storage in a transparent way. The platform uses gamification to integrate the game as part of the instructional process. The CyberScratch project is a particular implementation of this architecture focused on cybersecurity game-based activities. The data privacy management is a critical issue for these kinds of platforms, so the architecture is designed with this feature integrated in the platform components. To achieve this goal, we first focus on all the privacy aspects for the data generated by our cloud game-based platform, by considering the European legal context for data privacy following GDPR and ISO/IEC TR 20748-1:2016 recommendations for Learning Analytics (LA). Our second objective is to provide implementation guidelines for efficient data privacy management for our cloud game-based educative platform. All these contributions are not found in current related works. The CyberScratch project, which was approved by UNED for the year 2020, considers using the xAPI standard for data handling and services for the game editor, game engine and game monitor modules of CyberScratch. Therefore, apart from considering GDPR privacy and LA recommendations, our cloud game-based architecture covers all phases from game creation to the final users’ interactions with the game."

The BioNLP group at Department of Data Science and Engineering in Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal (IISERB) has participated in this challenge and submitted three runs based on three different text mining models. The severity of depression were categorized into three classes, viz., no depression, moderate, and severe and the data to build models were released as part of this shared task. The objective of this work is to identify relevant features from the given social media texts for effective text classification. As part of our investigation, we explored features derived from text data using document embeddings technique and simple bag of words model following different weighting schemes. Subsequently, adaptive boosting, logistic regression, random forest and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to identify the scale of depression from the given texts. The experimental analysis on the given validation data show that the SVM classifier using the bag of words model following term frequency and inverse document frequency weighting scheme outperforms the other models for identifying depression. However, this framework could not achieve a place among the top ten runs of the shared task. This paper describes the potential of the proposed framework as well as the possible reasons behind mediocre performance on the given data."
bc6d0e96459fd70ef656ce0c7fed48341698efa8,developing a flexible learning activity on biodiversity and spatial scale concepts using openaccess vegetation datasets from the national ecological observatory network,"Abstract Biodiversity is a complex, yet essential, concept for undergraduate students in ecology and other natural sciences to grasp. As beginner scientists, students must learn to recognize, describe, and interpret patterns of biodiversity across various spatial scales and understand their relationships with ecological processes and human influences. It is also increasingly important for undergraduate programs in ecology and related disciplines to provide students with experiences working with large ecological datasets to develop students’ data science skills and their ability to consider how ecological processes that operate at broader spatial scales (macroscale) affect local ecosystems. To support the goals of improving student understanding of macroscale ecology and biodiversity at multiple spatial scales, we formed an interdisciplinary team that included grant personnel, scientists, and faculty from ecology and spatial sciences to design a flexible learning activity to teach macroscale biodiversity concepts using large datasets from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). We piloted this learning activity in six courses enrolling a total of 109 students, ranging from midlevel ecology and GIS/remote sensing courses, to upper‐level conservation biology. Using our classroom experiences and a pre/postassessment framework, we evaluated whether our learning activity resulted in increased student understanding of macroscale ecology and biodiversity concepts and increased familiarity with analysis techniques, software programs, and large spatio‐ecological datasets. Overall, results suggest that our learning activity improved student understanding of biological diversity, biodiversity metrics, and patterns of biodiversity across several spatial scales. Participating faculty reflected on what went well and what would benefit from changes, and we offer suggestions for implementation of the learning activity based on this feedback. This learning activity introduced students to macroscale ecology and built student skills in working with big data (i.e., large datasets) and performing basic quantitative analyses, skills that are essential for the next generation of ecologists."

The result of the collaboration, the big data scientist training enhancement program (BD-STEP) was launched in 2015 with the objective of enabling a transition from the traditional healthcare model of observe and treat to a desired future state of predict and prevent. The BD-STEP Program brings together expertise of clinicians, researchers and data scientists to use EMR data to directly impact patient decision-making. This program represents a first time collaboration in VA of the Office of Academic Affiliations, Employee Education System, and the Office of Research and Development with the intended outcome of bridging the gap between the administrative, clinical, and research worlds to achieving a common goal—to train the next generation of data scientists to understand data in the context of health care delivery. As an interdisciplinary program, BD-STEP will provide data scientists trained to use EMR data to: (1) accelerate learning (2) inform healthcare systems administrators and; (3) empower clinicians to translate findings to improve patient care. This review will provide an overview of the intersection of precision medicine, data science, and patient engagement, and share a vision for how BD-STEP will use a team science approach to deliver personalized care for patients to reduce cost and improve outcomes.

55d440d3b751551a7b69bd8029d99a8bc9120cc2,perceptions of learning mathematics among lower secondary students in malaysia study on students engagement using fuzzy conjoint analysis,"As Malaysia strives to embrace the Data Science & Big Data revolution, the need to produce graduates with higher mathematics competence grows accordingly. However, the nation's vision may face a threat due to the declining interest to learn mathematics among the younger generations. Although initiatives like STEM was undertaken to face this issue, the success rate was relatively low. Ultimately, the key driver of mathematics learning is students' interest; which can be described using their perceptions of learning mathematics. Accordingly, this paper evaluated the perceptions of learning mathematics among lower secondary school students in Malaysia. A descriptive survey study was conducted on 562 randomly selected students across Peninsular Malaysia. The instrument consisted of 54 attributes encompassing 3 constructs of classroom engagement. Ratings on attributes were analysed using Fuzzy Conjoint Analysis to identify the significant attributes and their in influence. The most significant attribute indicated that students tried multiple times if they were unable to tackle a given problem. The least significant attribute revealed that students were always afraid of getting poor results in mathematics tests. Results attested that students had varying perceptions, however, their overall perceptions of learning mathematics were positive. Negative and neutral perceptions mainly existed for affective engagement, particularly for students' anxiety and frustration in learning mathematics. This provides important information for education stakeholders to improve the affective component of engagement. In a nutshell, this study served as an initial attempt to investigate students' perceptions of learning mathematics with respect to their classroom engagement."
ed7936273dd0a21aeb6fd235e19575240c61e91d,evaluation of a training program to improve organizational capacity for health systems analytics,"OBJECTIVE
 The Leadership in Analytics and Data Science (LEADS) course was evaluated for effectiveness. LEADS was a 6-month program for working biomedical and health informatics (BMHI) professionals designed to improve analytics skills, knowledge of enterprise applications, data stewardship, and to foster an analytics community of practice through lectures, hands-on skill building workshops, networking events, and small group projects.


METHODS
 The effectiveness of the LEADS course was evaluated using the Kirkpatrick Model by assessing pre- and postcourse knowledge, analytics capabilities, goals, practice, class lecture reaction, and change in the size of participant professional networks. Differences in pre- and postcourse responses were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test to determine significance, and effect sizes were computed using a z-statistic.


RESULTS
 Twenty-nine students completed the course with 96% of respondents reporting that they were ""very"" or ""extremely"" likely to recommend the course. Participants reported improvement in several analytics capabilities including Epic data warehousing (p = 0.017), institutional review board policy (p = 0.005), and data stewardship (p = 0.007). Changes in practice patterns mirrored those in self-reported capability. On average, the participant professional network doubled.


CONCLUSION
 LEADS was the first course targeted to working BMHI professional at a large academic medical center to have a formal effectiveness evaluation be published in the literature. The course achieved the goals of expansion of BMHI knowledge, skills, and professional networks. The LEADS course provides a template for continuing education of working BMHI professionals."
16f65572e4788fb4c7f3ea30316ea28bd774757e,research priorities for kidneyrelated researchan agenda to advance kidney care a position statement from the national kidney foundation,"Despite the high prevalence and economic burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD), federal funding for kidney-related research, prevention, and education activities under the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) remains substantially lower compared to other chronic diseases. More federal support is needed to promote critical research that will expand knowledge of kidney health and disease, develop new and effective therapies, and reduce health disparities. In 2021, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) convened two Research Roundtables (preclinical and clinical research), comprising nephrology leaders from prominent U.S. academic institutions and the pharmaceutical industry, key bodies with expertise in research, and including individuals with CKD and their caregivers, and kidney donors. The goal of these roundtables was to identify priorities for preclinical and clinical kidney-related research. The research priorities identified by the Research Roundtables and presented in this position statement outline attainable opportunities for groundbreaking and critically needed innovations that will benefit patients with kidney disease in the next five to 10 years. Research priorities fall within four preclinical science themes (expand data science capability; define kidney disease mechanisms and utilize genetic tools to identify new therapeutic targets; develop better models of human disease; and test cell-specific drug delivery systems and utilize gene editing) and three clinical science themes (expand number and inclusivity of clinical trials; develop and test interventions to reduce health disparities; and support implementation science). These priorities in kidney-related research, if supported by additional funding by federal agencies, will increase our understanding of the development and progression of kidney disease among diverse populations, attract additional industry investment, and lead to new and more personalized treatments."

Some common trends were identified in multiple groups, but the perspectives on these trends differed from group to group and sometimes even among panel members in the same group. In this Commentary, I briefly summarize and comment on the findings of each panel, then discuss and provide perspectives on 7 common themes addressed by multiple groups: acceleration of technological change; remote care/teledentistry; disparities and inequities in health and access to health care; the aging population and increased number of persons with multiple chronic conditions; convergence of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning; integration of dental and medical primary care; and changing payment systems, including value-based care. Finally, the implications of these findings for translational research are discussed. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This article reviews social, economic, and technological trends affecting the future of dentistry. These trends have important implications for the training of dentists and the organization of dental care with the aim of improving the oral health of the public. Clinical and translational research has an essential role to play in developing the interventions and evidence base for these improvements."
3bd9f6f6b6606c04ffefed1d9e21e33b7e03aeb9,network psychometrics and cognitive network science open new ways for understanding math anxiety as a complex system,"
 Math anxiety is a clinical pathology impairing cognitive processing in math-related contexts. Originally thought to affect only inexperienced, low-achieving students, recent investigations show how math anxiety is vastly diffused even among high-performing learners. This review of data-informed studies outlines math anxiety as a complex system that: (i) cripples well-being, self-confidence and information processing on both conscious and subconscious levels, (ii) can be transmitted by social interactions, like a pathogen, and worsened by distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20$\%$ of students in 63 out of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly with academic performance and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students’ well-being, computational literacy and career prospects in science. These patterns underline the crucial need to go beyond performance for estimating math anxiety. Recent advances in network psychometrics and cognitive network science provide ideal frameworks for detecting, interpreting and intervening upon such clinical condition. Merging education research, psychology and data science, the approaches reviewed here reconstruct psychological constructs as complex systems, represented either as multivariate correlation models (e.g. graph exploratory analysis) or as cognitive networks of semantic/emotional associations (e.g. free association networks or forma mentis networks). Not only can these interconnected networks detect otherwise hidden levels of math anxiety but—more crucially—they can unveil the specific layout of interacting factors, for example, key sources and targets, behind math anxiety in a given cohort. As discussed here, these network approaches open concrete ways for unveiling students’ perceptions, emotions and mental well-being, and can enable future powerful data-informed interventions untangling math anxiety."

We explore some of the challenges and opportunities in optimizing data integration to accelerate breast cancer discovery and improve patient outcomes. Susan G. Komen convened three meetings (2015, 2017, and 2018) with various stakeholders to discuss challenges, opportunities, and next steps to enhance the use of big data in the field of breast cancer. Meeting participants agreed that big data approaches can enhance the identification of better therapies, improve outcomes, reduce disparities, and optimize precision medicine. One challenge is that databases must be shared, linked with each other, standardized, and interoperable. Patients want to be active participants in research and their own care, and to control how their data are used. Many patients have privacy concerns and do not understand how sharing their data can help to effectively drive discovery. Public education is essential, and breast cancer researchers who are skilled in using and analyzing big data are needed. Patient advocacy groups can play multiple roles to help maximize and leverage big data to better serve patients. Komen is committed to educating patients on big data issues, encouraging data sharing by all stakeholders, assisting in training the next generation of data science breast cancer researchers, and funding research projects that will use real-life data in real time to revolutionize the way breast cancer is understood and treated."

As a result, many students are required to complete their studies in departments of the abolished TEI. Dropout or a delay in graduation is a significant problem that results from newly joined students at the university, in addition to the provision of studies. There are various reasons for this, with student performance during studies being one of the major contributing factors. This study was aimed at predicting the time required for weak students to pass their courses so as to allow the university to develop strategic programs that will help them improve performance and graduate in time. This paper presents various components of educational data mining incorporating a new state-of-the-art strategy, called AutoML, which is used to find the best models and parameters and is capable of predicting the length of time required for students to pass their courses using their past course performance and academic information. A dataset of 23,687 “Computer Networking” module students was used to train and evaluate the classification of a model developed in the KNIME Analytics (open source) data science platform. The accuracy of the model was measured using well-known evaluation criteria, such as precision, recall, and F-measure. The model was applied to data related to three basic courses and correctly predicted approximately 92% of students’ performance and, specifically, students who are likely to drop out or experience a delay before graduating."

However, many challenges in course delivery require further understanding, for example, factors exploring the reasons for high MOOC dropout rates, recorded low social interaction between learners and the lack of understanding of the impact of a course facilitators’ presence in course engagement. There is a need to generate further evidence to explore these detriments to MOOC course delivery to enable enhanced course learning design. The proposed mixed-methods evaluation of the MOOC was determined based on the MOOC’s aims and objectives and the methodological approaches used to evaluate this type of a course. The MOOC evaluation will help appraise the effectiveness of the MOOC in delivering its intended objectives. This protocol aims to describe the design of a study evaluating learners knowledge, skills and attitudes in a MOOCs about data science for healthcare. Methods and analysis Study participants will be recruited from learners who have registered for the MOOC. On registration, learners will be given an opportunity to opt into the study and complete informed consent. Following completion of the course, study participants will be contacted to complete semistructured interviews. Interviews will be transcribed and coded using thematic analysis, with data analysed using two evaluation models: (1) the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance framework and the (2) Kirkpatrick model drawing data from pre and post-course surveys and post-MOOC semi-structured interviews. The primary goal of the evaluation is to appraise participants' knowledge, skills and attitude after taking the MOOC. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval for this study was obtained from Imperial College London through the Education Ethics Review Process (EERP) (EERP1617-030). A summary of the research findings will be reported through a peer-reviewed journal and will be presented at an international conference."

This academic strength goes a long way to determine the quality of academic product expected from such an institution. To this effect, this study aims at analyzing the research publication strength of 70 Nigerian universities that are visible in Scopus database for Computer Science from inception to 22 December 2017. They include 35 federal, 27 state and 8 private universities. This study is divided into two phases; the first phase consists of six major steps in a waterfall model and the second is carried out by adopting a knowledge discovery model using a clustering algorithm for pattern discovery in an unstructured data model. The data source for the analysis is the Scopus indexing database recommended by the Times Higher Education for international ranking of higher institutions. From the first phase, the predominant outlet for each institution was discovered alongside the percentage of publications in the dominant outlet and the number of publications by the institution within the database over the period of the analysis. In the second phase, the predominant areas of research of each institution within the field of Computer Science was determined. In particular, it was observed that such areas as deep learning and data science are under researched. The findings also revealed networking as the most published area in Nigerian universities, and a number of Nigerian computer science scholars engage in application research which link Computer Science with other disciplines with Nigeria and Africa as case studies. The findings from this research can support postgraduate students’ decision in making the right choice of institution based on their research interest. It will also serve as an eye-opener for industries in promoting a result-oriented university-industry partnership."
51623380bc75943aea29a1c7e44fe3bc66b3ee44,identification of digital health priorities for palliative care research modified delphi study,"Background Developments in digital health have the potential to transform the delivery of health and social care to help citizens manage their health. Currently, there is a lack of consensus about digital health research priorities in palliative care and a lack of theories about how these technologies might improve care outcomes. Therefore, it is important for health care leaders to identify innovations to ensure that an increasingly frail population has appropriate access to palliative care services. Consequently, it is important to articulate research priorities as the first step in determining how finite resources should be allocated to a field saturated with rapidly developing innovation. Objective The aim of this study is to identify research priority areas for digital health in palliative care. Methods We selected digital health trends, most relevant to palliative care, from a list of emerging trends reported by a leading institute of quantitative futurists. We conducted 2 rounds of the Delphi questionnaire, followed by a consensus meeting and public engagement workshop to establish a final consensus on research priorities for digital technology in palliative care. We used the views of public representatives to gain their perspectives on the agreed priorities. Results A total of 103 experts (representing 11 countries) participated in the first Delphi round. Of the 103 experts, 55 (53.3%) participated in the second round. The final consensus meetings were attended by 10.7% (11/103) of the experts. We identified 16 priority areas, which involved many applications of technologies, including care for patients and caregivers, self-management and reporting of diseases, education and training, communication, care coordination, and research methodology. We summarized the priority areas into eight topics: big data, mobile devices, telehealth and telemedicine, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, smart home, biotechnology, and digital legacy. Conclusions The priorities identified in this study represent a wide range of important emerging areas in the fields of digital health, personalized medicine, and data science. Human-centered design and robust governance systems should be considered in future research. It is important that the risks of using these technologies in palliative care are properly addressed to ensure that these tools are used meaningfully, wisely, and safely and do not cause unintentional harm."
